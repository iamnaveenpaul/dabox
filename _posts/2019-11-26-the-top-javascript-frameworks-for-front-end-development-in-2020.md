title: The Top JavaScript Frameworks For Front-End Development in 2020
---

**This may already be familiar to front-end developers, when you Google "top JavaScript frameworks" and you get so many JavaScript frameworks to choose from.**

Selecting a JavaScript platform for front-end development is always challenging. As JavaScript implementations always have more options.

But, in their software stacks, what are front-end programmers searching for? I realize it's all about rapid development so easy-to-make UIs as a full-time programmer.

Around 450 + programmers at [ValueCoders](https://www.valuecoders.com/) software development agency, voted and shortlisted some of the strongest JavaScript implementations, rather than attempting to be definitive.

**Our Vote Goes to React**

I wasn't shocked to see that. As one of the strongest JavaScript implementations, most of our developers voted for React. On the way our front-end programmers tackled a lot of projects that demonstrated the capabilities of the JS platform. React provides the combination: Reusable modules, Routing and model process, synchronization and display.

Through relying heavily on React, the programmers applied front-end logic. At the same time, I was surprised at how easy it was with React to build applications.

**Overview of the app**

The software is clear. It's a music teachers [studio management app](https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/online-music-school) that helps them concentrate more on their instruction and less on their music studio operations.

The key challenge for educators was to establish a 'Activity Dashboard' where they could monitor all the actions of their students and track their progress over time. By using [Redux libraries](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem) to create the framework, we overcome this obstacle. We designed a workshop for teachers from where they could track the success of their pupils, showcase new music lessons, talk to them, compare music with students live music, and also providing feedback to them.

Anyway, this is my experience with React JS. But with many useful tools, many would claim that Vue is one of the finest JavaScript front-end frameworks.

Front-end programmers determine which JavaScript framework is going to do the job. They face a lot of difficulties in doing so because they have to determine what they always need. They also have to choose a platform for JavaScript now, not after a week of testing. Many programmers are moving with what they learned in that situation. But perhaps the stacks you're comfortable with don't cut it in the performance.

Even it's difficult for new developers to choose among Angular, React, a Vue. Rather than make it more detailed for you, here is the collection for front-end programmers of the best JavaScript frameworks.

**The Big 5**

In terms of popularity and use, the five JavaScript frameworks that actually dominate the market are: React, Vue, Angular, Ember and Backbone.js.

Each of them has large communities. If you're a front-end developer or launch your own front-end software venture, these five will be your best bets. Here's a peek at the last six months npm patterns.

**1. React**

React is the probable JS world leader. The JavaScript frameworks takes a [reactive approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) methodology and incorporates many of its own front-end web design as well.

To use React, you will need to know how to use a variety of additional tools to achieve high front-end design mobility. This is a less exhaustive list of modules you can use with React, for example: Redux, MobX, Fluxy, Fluxible, or RefluxJS. JQuery AJAX, fetch API, Superagent, and Axios can also be used.

**Concurrent Mode:**

“Today, we're excited to share the first early community preview of Concurrent Mode. It offers new composable primitives to help you orchestrate delightful user experiences.” @reactjs on twitter.

[Here](https://t.co/mMrCmv4D5U) is the link

React works continuously to boost the simultaneous function. React Conf 2019 wrapped up last month to take this forward, where the React team spoke about improving the [Concurrent Mode and the Suspense model](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/11/06/building-great-user-experiences-with-concurrent-mode-and-suspense.html). These features make applications from React more reactive by creating trees without thread blocking. It makes it possible to focus on high-priority activities such as reacting to user input.

**Suspense**

In addition, React introduced Suspense to improve the developer's experience when handling asynchronous data collection in React apps. In short, the new Suspense update allows the component to wait for a condition to be fulfilled.

Hooks is another major update to React 16.8. [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) helps you to use all of React's essential functionality–server-side rendering, usability, concurrent mode and suspense, all without a class writing.

React applications are divided into multiple components containing functions for both business logic and HTML markup. Developers can use either Flux or a related JavaScript library to improve communication between components.

Recently, React added objects such as state and props. You may simply transfer information from an element to the design or from a parent component to a child component with the state and props objects.

Introduction to the React ecosystem:

* For implementing routes, the React library and router.
* React-DOM for manipulation of DOM.
* For Firefox and Chrome browsers, react developer tools.
* React JSX, a markup language that mixes HTML into JavaScript.
* To set up a React project, React Create App command line interface.
* To organize communication with the backend team, Redux and Axios libraries.

React is definitely one of JavaScript's most common frameworks. Then, you can choose React first to build advanced-grade applications.

**2. Angular 2 to Angular 9**

At the latest AngularConnect 2019, Angular 9 will represent a turning point announced by the Angular group. The team plans to make the [Angular Ivy compiler](https://angular.io/guide/ivy) usable for all applications, according to the update. Angular Ivy's main advantage is that it can reduce the applications size.

Today's Angular has become very sophisticated and scalable for front-end development. You may previously add a reference to the AngularJS library in the main HTML folder, but by downloading different modules, you can do the same now.

The versatility of Angular is praiseworthy. This is why the 1.x iterations of Angular are still in order. Nonetheless, owing to its MVC design, which has substantially changed to a component-based architecture, most developers currently rely on Angular 2 +.

Angular has a number other problems. You are almost required to use TypeScript in Angular apps to ensure type protection. TypeScript allows it not so easy to work with the Angular 2 + system.

Angular’s ecosystem is comprised of:

* Angular's command line interface is helpful for quick project setup
* Developers will receive a set of Angular projects modules: @angular/common, @angular/compiler, @angular/core, @angular/forms, @angular/http, @angular/platform-browser, @angular/platform-browser-dynamic, @angular/router, and @angular/upgrade.
* Angular uses Zone.js which is a JS library used in Angular apps to implement zones.
* TypeScript and CoffeeScript can be used with Angular.
* Angular uses RxJS and the Observable pattern for communication with server-side apps.
* For debugging Angular apps, Angular Augury.
* For creating server-side apps, Angular Universal.

Angular2 is a full JavaScript platform that contains all the tools required by a modern front-end developer. If you don't like dealing with external modules like React, you can choose Angular.

**3. Vue**

The 2019 JavaScript framework document for Snyk JavaScript is out. The report focused primarily on safety risks in both React and Angular. @snyksec on twitter

[Here](https://t.co/FIpSob2IHk) is the link

Angular and Respond took the concept of Vue, but in many respects Vue is stronger. I'm going to talk about its functionality, but first see what the Synk report says about the front-end safety of Vue. This year, Vue has been downloaded 40 million times and only reports [four direct vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:vue). They've all been set.

Let's explain a few things for any front-end user unfamiliar with Vue.

For Vue, logic and format elements are contained in one directory along with stylesheets. This is the same approach, without stylesheets, React functions. Vue uses props and state artifacts to enable components to talk to each other. There was also this method in React before it was implemented by Vue.

Unlike Angular, Vue allows you to combine JavaScript with HTML templates. To interpolate values from the module logic to models, you need to use Vue parameters such as v-bind or v-if.

One of the reasons that Vue should be considered instead of React is due to the Redux library, which is often used for large-scale React applications. As described in the React page, you can spend a lot of time making small changes to several files instead of actually working on functionality when a React+Redux device grows bigger. The Vuex Library-a flux-like state management resource for visualization tends to be less daunting than Redux.

If you choose between Vue and Angular, the arguments for preferring Vue over Angular can be simplified to the following: Angular is a complex, full-fledged, rigid framework; Vue is much easier and less restrictive than Angular.

One Perspective of Angular and React benefit is that you don't need to learn JavaScript again.

An introduction to the VueJS ecosystem:

* Vuex has a dedicated application management library.
* Vuex is close to Flux's definition.
* With Chrome and Firefox browsers, you'll get Vue-loader with components and view.js devtools.
* Vue-resource and Axios communication tools between Vue and the origins of the backend.
* Vue.js allows Nuxt.js to build server-side frameworks for Vue; Nuxt.js is effectively an Angular Universal competitor.
* You will provide a Weex JavaScript library with a Vue syntax used for the development of mobile apps.
* In spite of their approach to other frameworks, the Vue is fantastic. I might go for Vue because it's less complex than React and Angular JS and a great choice for business-level applications.

**4. Ember**

This year, Ember 3.13 introduced new enhancements and functionality. Ember is one of the oldest JavaScript frameworks like Backbone and AngularJS. But [Ember 3.13](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/09/25/ember-3-13-released.html) is compatible with new bug fixes, improvements in performance and deprecation, with the new update. Tracked property improvements were also added to allow easier ways to track adjustments in the Ember applications ergonomic process.

Ember has a comparatively complex design that helps you to quickly build massive applications on the client side. This produces a standard MVC JavaScript framework, and the design of Ember includes the following parts: adapters, components, controllers, helpers, models, routes, services, templates, utils and addons.

One of the best features of Ember is its design method for the command line. The Ember CLI supports highly productive front-end designers and encourages them to finish tasks on schedule. Not only can you create new projects with ready setups, but you can also use automatic generation to create controllers, components, and project files.

The EmberJS ecosystem is comprised of:

* Ember CLI method for rapid prototyping and dependency management.
* Ember server has been introduced into the application development process.
* For data management, you will get Ember.js library and Ember data.
* Handlebars template engine for Ember applications.
* QUnit Ember testing framework.
* Resource for the design of Chrome and Firefox apps by Ember Inspector.
* Ember Public Storage Observer and Ember addons to incorporate generic functionalities.

Ember is great for creating complex client-side applications even though it is underestimated.

**5. Backbone.js**

Backbone is a MVC architecture-based JavaScript framework. The MVC View aims to execute part logic identical to a controller in Backbone.js. Engines such as Mustache and Underscore.js can be used to display Backbone.

Backbone is an easy-to-use JavaScript framework that enables quick single-page application development. You will have to choose tools to use Backbone.js to the fullest extent like Chaplin, Marionette, Thorax, Handlebars, Mustache, etc.

Backbone collections (arrays) can be used here to differentiate the templates if you need to build an app that has different types of clients. For Backbone models, collections, routes, and views, Backbone.Events can be used.

Introducing the BackboneJS ecosystem:

* The Backbone library is made up of events, models, collections, views, and router.
* Underscore.js, a JavaScript library with helper functions that can be used to implement cross-browser JavaScript.
* Template engines such as Mustache and jQuery-tmpl can be used.
* [BackPlug](http://backplug.io/) online repository with many ready-made implementations for Backbone-based applications.
* Backbone generator CLI can be used for Backbone app development.
* To build an advanced architecture for Backbone apps, Marionette, Thorax, and Chaplin JavaScript libraries can be used.

Backbone.js is a perfect choice for front-end and back-end design as it provides REST APIs for front-end and back-end synchronization.
