Most people follow certain predefined steps through basic instincts that allow them to effectively solve a coding problem. You might even follow some of these steps knowingly or not, when you are unconsciously asked a question, but you will try to relate to these incredible steps and you will be able to solve the problem more effectively, after reading this article.

So I'm going to talk about 5 steps that you can take when addressing every coding problem for this article - the world requires programmers, why should I spend time on competitive [programming](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming)?

I find that most developers out there (including many "really" professional programmers) are not good at data structures, algorithms, or overall problem solving. Being a developer myself, It's a sad thing that many people are just cramming some basic steps for creating an application these days, or a simple program and calling themselves "coders."

With everyone looking for advancement and in-depth learning of algorithms and data structures, although it is an integral domain for each student, but it has become a second choice for students these days.

I try to give more time to learn about data structures and algorithms and how to write successful software, even though I am a programmer and know not too much about competitive programming, and I support and suggest as well that everyone work on this.

So here are some examples where data structures, algorithms and (generally) competitive programming would support students:

1. Writing good quality code.
2. Efficient code (Time and space complexity).
3. College Placements.
4. Making optimum use of resources.
5. Logical reasoning.
6. Exposure (there is a huge community of students who do CP).
7. Opportunities (Tons of CP Contests out there).
8. You will have a lot of fun in the process.

Now moving on further to our topic,

**Whenever I am given any coding question, I follow these 5 Steps:**

I found that in whatever problem I solve, I have a pattern, while I was doing a coding query a few days ago. Before and after I solved some problems, I did some more problems and kept writing down what was in my mind. To my surprise, there was a common pattern, I did these 5 things unknowingly, and now that I know about these 5 steps, now with more efficiency I can solve those problems.

Also, It‚Äôs highly likely that you will also unconsciously use these steps, as I said before, but you will start applying them actively and then notice the difference when you find that out.

**1. Understand and Analyse the Problem**

Start thinking about the problem after carefully reading it and write on a piece of paper if possible, the things that are given and the things you need to find out.

Ask yourself,

* Do you fully understand this question?
* ‚ÄäCan you explain the question to a layman?
* ‚ÄäWhat is needed and how many inputs?
* ‚ÄäWhat is the output for those inputs?
* ‚ÄäCan you isolate from the problem for some modules or parts?
* ‚ÄäDo you have sufficient  information? If not, try understanding the question again.

**2. Go through the sample inputs and examples thoroughly**

Looking through some sample inputs and coming up with more examples certainly helps you a bit to understand the problem better, and it also gives you a clear path to how many cases the software can handle, and what all the potential output and output scope can be.

Here‚Äôs what I would suggest, Find the output by taking simple examples and taking more complex and bigger inputs, and see how many use cases do we need.

Then it‚Äôs time to manage the edge cases, try the problem out and see the output with no or invalid input.

**3. Break down the problem**

This step is really very helpful when the problem at hand is very big. In such cases, I recommend the following,

* Try to create a flow chart or UML to solve the problem.
* ‚ÄäDivide the problem into various modules or sub-problems
* ‚ÄäTry to create separate functions for each sub-problem
* ‚ÄäLink these sub-problems by calling them in the order necessary or as needed (probably one function will call another)
* ‚ÄäConsider using classes and artifacts when answering questions that try to incorporate certain real-world issues (such as management systems, etc.).

**4. Start solving/coding**

It's time to write the code, now that the problem has been studied. Try to write code for a simpler subpart if you can't solve the problem fully at once. You can slowly find out more about the problem, as you solve the problem and you will begin to get new ideas.
You‚Äôll surely figure out the path by just keeping 3 things in mind

* Where you started?
* ‚ÄäWhere you are right now?
* ‚ÄäWhat is your destination?

Remember, if you give an interview, keep simplifying the problem and keep telling your interviewer about how you tackle the problem but don't waste time working out the whole answer and then ask your interviewer.

* Tell the interviewer how you try to get started
* ‚ÄäTell which approach is right now in your mind
* ‚ÄäFigure out the hardest part you're facing in this problem
* ‚ÄäIgnore that for some time for that most complicated part and continue to solve a simpler subpart, which will give you more time to think about the previous group.
* ‚ÄäTry to incorporate a similar approach for the difficult part when completed with the basic sub-parts.
* ‚ÄäYou can find a better solution for the way to the problem while tackling it, tell your interviewer that

**5. Look Back and Learn More**

This is the biggest part! Look back if the software can be changed once you're finished, is there any other way to solve the problem?

Don't just give up when you're finished, give up when you're satisfied with the potential solution(s) and have fully explored the problem!

Here are some questions that you should ask when you have finished writing the code

* Is this code running for every possible input (including edge cases) to solve the problem?
* Is this code effective? Can this be more effective?
* Is the code easy to read?
* Would you be able to understand it if someone else taught you this code?
* Is it possible to improve the performance?
* Is it possible to use some other algorithm that delivers better results?
* In addition to these questions, also find out the answers of other people to the same problem, check out how they solved it, you learn a lot while seeing the codes of others.

**Summary**

Here are the five things we spoke about in this article

* Analyze the problem and grasp it.
* Look at the inputs of samples and use cases.
* Distribution of the problem into smaller sub-parts or functions or modules.
* Start the resolution / coding process.
* When you're finished, look back if it's possible to improve the code, or if there's some other way to solve the problem.

That's it, I hope this article would improve your ability to solve problems
