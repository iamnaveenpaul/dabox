**List of Most Popular CSS Interview Questions with Answers:**

Examples will explain the CSS Questions covering nearly all basic and advanced CSS categories.

CSS is one of Web development's most essential features. It is a language in which the presence of web pages can be represented.

Therefore, covering all the basic and advanced parts of the CSS is important. You need to know CSS to become a good web designer and easily break the web developer interview.

For your easy understanding, the list of the most frequently asked CSS interview questions and answers is given below.

Let's Begin!!

**What is CSS?**

CSS outlines the style of an HTML webpage, it's a language in which we can set an HTML webpage's behavior. This explains how to view the HTML data on the computer.

CSS controls multiple HTML web pages layout. CSS is known as the Cascading Style Sheet.

**Name all the modules which are used in the current version of CSS.**

* Selectors
* Box Model
* Backgrounds and Borders
* Text Effects
* 2D/3D Transformations
* Animations
* Multiple Column Layout
* User Interface.

**Distinguish between CSS2 and CSS3.**

* CSS3 is split into two different sections, called a module. Whereas in CSS2, with all the data in it, it accesses a single document.
* On almost any platform, CSS3 modules are allowed and on the other side, CSS and CSS2 modules are not available in any browser.
* Within CSS3 we can note that many characteristics relevant to graphics such as Border-radius or box-shadow, flexbox, have been added.
* In CSS3, a user can use properties such as background-image, background-position and background-repeat styles for correct different background images on a website.

**Cite different types of CSS.**

* External – These are written in files that are separate.
* Internal – These are listed at the top of the code file on the web page.
* Inline – These are written directly next to the text.

**Why is the external style sheet useful?**

External style sheet is very convenient because we write all the styling codes in a single file and can be used anywhere by simply referring to the external style sheet file reference.

So if we make any changes to that external file, the changes can be seen on the webpage as well. So we can claim it's very helpful and while operating on bigger files it keeps the job simple.

**What are the uses of an embedded style sheet?**

In an HTML file, the embedded style sheet allows us the luxury of specifying styles within one place.

Using an embedded style sheet to use on multiple tag types of a web page, we can generate multiple classes and there is also no extra download needed to import the information.

Example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<style type="text/css">
p {
  font-family: georgia, serif;
  font-size: x-large;
  color:#ff9900;
  }
a:hover {
  color: LimeGreen;
  text-decoration: none;
  }
</style>
</head>

<body>
<p>In an HTML file, the embedded style sheet allows us the luxury of specifying styles within one place. Using an embedded style sheet to use on multiple tag types of a web page, we can generate multiple classes and there is also no extra download needed to import the information.
</p>
</body> 

</html>
```

**How to use CSS selector?**

Using the CSS selector, we can pick the element we want to style so we can say it's a link between the style sheet and the HTML files.

CSS selector syntax is "select" HTML items that have been generated on their Id, class, type etc.

**Explain the concept of Tweening.**

Tweening is the method in which we create intermediate frames between two images so that the first image emerges into the second image.

It is used mostly to generate animation.

**Define CSS image scripts.**

CSS image scripts are a collection of images embedded in a single image.

By projecting multiple images into a single web page, this decreases the load time and query number to the server.

**Explain the term Responsive web design.**

It is a process in which we design and create a web page based on user behaviors and requirements based on various components such as screen size, web page portability on the various devices, etc.

It is therefore achieved using multiple dynamic layouts and grids.

**What are CSS counters?**

CSS counters are variables that can be improved by CSS laws which measure the number of times the variable was used.

**What is CSS specificity?**

The specificity of CSS is a rating or rank that specifies which declaration of style to use for an element

This universal selector has low specificity although ID selectors have high specificity.

In CSS, there are four categories that authorized the selector's specificity level.

* Inline style
* IDs
* Classes, Attributes, and pseudo-classes.
* Elements and pseudo-elements.

**How can we calculate specificity?**

We must begin with 0 to determine the specificity, then add 1000 for each ID and add 10 to the attributes, classes or pseudo-classes with each element name or pseudo-element and add 1 to them later.

As Example:

```
h2
             #content h2
            <div id=”content”>
              <h2 style=”color:#FF0000”>heading</h2>
            </div>
```

**How do we make a rounded corner by using CSS?**

Use the "border-radius" property to create a rounded edge. This property can be extended to any element.

Ex:

```
<html>
<head>

<style>
#rcorners1 {
    border-radius: 25px;
    background: #715751;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 200px;
    height: 150px;   
}

</style>
</head>

<body>
<h1>The border-radius Property</h1>
<p>Rounded corners for an element with a specified background color:</p>
<p id="rcorners1">Rounded corners!</p>
</body>

</html>
```

**How will you add border images to an HTML element?**

By using the CSS "border-image" attribute, we may set the image to be used as the border image next to an element.

Example:

```
#borderimg {
    border: 15px solid transparent;
    padding: 20px;
    border-image: url(border.png) 30 round;
}
```

**What are gradients in CSS?**

It is a CSS attribute that helps you to view a seamless transition between two or more colors.

Linear and Radial Gradient are two types of gradients in CSS.

**What is CSS flexbox?**

It enables you to design a flexible, responsive layout structure without using any CSS float or positioning property. Originally, you need to identify a flex container to use the CSS flexbox.

Example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

<style>
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  background-color: #f4b042;
}

.flex-container > div {
  background-color: #d60a33;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 30px;
}

</style>
</head>

<body>
<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div> 
</div>
<p> Example of  <em>flex</em>box.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Write all the properties of the flexbox.**

In the HTML website, flexbox properties used are flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, justify-content, align-items, align-content etc.

**How to align image vertically in a division that spans vertically on the whole webpage?**

Using the syntax verticle-align: middle in the `<div1>` element can be achieved, and even we can connect the two text spans with another span and after that we have to use verticle-align: middle in the #icon data.

**What is the difference between padding and margin?**

The margin in CSS is the property which helps us to create space around elements Even to the externally defined borders, we may create space.

In CSS we have properties of margin as: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and Margin-left.

The property of Margin has certain specified values by using the following properties:

Auto – The margin is determined by the browser.
Length – this sets the magnitude of margin in px, pt, cm etc.
% – It sets the percentage of width in the element.
Inherit – with this we can inherit the property of margin from the parent element.

In CSS, padding is the property that helps us to create space around the content of an element as well as within some specified border

CSS padding also has properties such as:

Padding-top, Padding-right, Padding-bottom, Padding-left

Negative values are ineffective in padding.

```
div {
padding-top: 50px;
padding-right: 30px;
padding-bottom: 60px;
padding-left: 50px;
}
```

**What is the use of the Box Model in CSS?**

The box model in CSS is a box that binds all elements of HTML and includes features such as margins, border, padding, and actual content.

By using a box model we will have the right to insert the borders around the elements and we can also establish the gap between the elements.

**How can we add icons to the web page?**

With an icon library such as font-awesome, we could apply icons to the HTML web page.

We must assign to any inline HTML element the name of the specified icon class (`<I>` or` <span>`) Icons are scalable vectors in the icon libraries that can be modified using CSS.

**What is a CSS pseudo-class?**

It is a class used to define an HTML element's special state.

The class can be used when a client snooped over it by styling an element and when it gets the attention, it can also style an HTML element

```
selector:pseudo-class {
property:value;
}
```

**Explain the concept of pseudo-elements in CSS.**

It is a CSS attribute that is used to style the element's specified pieces.

For example, we may style an HTML element's first letter or line.

```
selector::pseudo-element {
property:value;
}
```

**What is CSS opacity?**

It is the property which elaborates on the element's transparency

By this property, the image that can take the values from 0.0-1.0 can be transparent, if the value is lower, then the image becomes more transparent. The values of IE8 and earlier browser versions can range from 0-100.

```
img {
opacity: 0.6;
filter: alpha(opacity=60); /* For IE8 and earlier */}
```

**Write all the position states used in CSS.**

There are four position states in CSS stated as Static(default), Relative, Fixed and absolute.

**What are navigation bars in CSS?**

We may transform an ordinary HTML site into a user-specific and more interactive web page by using navigation bars.

Essentially, it is a set of connections, so it makes perfect sense to use `<ul>` and `<li>` components.

```
ul {
list-style-type: none;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}
```

**What are the differences between relative and absolute in CSS?**

The main difference between relative and absolute is that in CSS "relative" is used for the same tag, meaning that if we write the left: 10px then the padding shifts to 10px in the left while the absolute is completely relative to the non-static parent.

If we write left: 10px, it means that the result is 10px away from the parent element's left edge.

**Define ‘important’ declarations used in CSS.**

The declaration statement that is more important than the normal declaration.

When conducting, these declarations overpowers the less important declarations.

When two users have an important declaration then one of the declarations can circumvent that user's claim.

For Example:

`Body {background: #FF00FF !important; color: blue}`

In this, as compared to the color body, background has more weight.

**Define different cascading methods that can be used inside the cascading order.**

Cascading order is itself a method of sorting that enables several different methods of sorting:

#1) Sort by Origin: there are some rules that can provide an alternative way to define:

The normal weight of a single provider's style sheet will be overridden by the user's elevated style sheet weight.

The normal width of the provider's style sheet will override the stylesheet rules of a particular user.

#2) Sort by selector's specificity: the more precise selector overrides the less common selector.

A Contextual selector, for example, is less precise relative to the more common ID selector, and the ID selector overrides the Contextual selector.

#3) Sort by order specified: This is the case in the situation where the weight and other properties of the two selectors is the same as that of the overriding specification.

Example:

If the style parameter is used for inline style, all other types will be overridden.

And if the link element is also used for external style the imported style will be overridden.

**Differentiate between inline and block element.**

Inline element has no element for setting width and height, and it also has no line break.

Example: em,  strong, etc.

Block element specification:

Posses the line break.
By setting a container, they define the width and also allow height to be set.
It may also include an element in the inline portion that happens.

Example:

width and height
max-width and max-height
min-width and min-height
hi (i=1-6)- heading element
p- Paragraph element.

**How is the concept of inheritance applied in CSS?**

Inheritance is a principle in which the child class inherits the parent class property.

It is a concept used in many languages and is the easy way to redefine the same property.

Defining the scale from the top level to the bottom level is used in CSS. If the child uses the same name, inherited property can be overridden by the child's class.

Example:

`Body {font-size: 15pt;}`

In the child's class another description is known

```
Body {font-size: 15pt;}
H1 {font-size: 18pt;}
```

Using the property, all the paragraph text will be shown and specified in the body except for the H1 type that will only show the text in font 18.

**Differentiate between the ID and class.**

* The Id is a type of element which specifically assigns a name to a particular element, while class has an object with a collection of properties that can be used for the entire block.
* The Id can be used as an element because it can identify it uniquely, while class is defined as blocking the elements and can be implemented too many tags wherever it is used.
* Id restricts the use of its property to a specific element while the inheritance is extended to a particular block or set of elements in the class.
