Either you love it or hate it, but you can't ignore JavaScript in the era of Microservice and REST API.

JavaScript was once used only in the client side(browser), but node js (execution engine/run time/web server) made it possible to operate the server-side javascript. On Desktop/Server/Mobile etc, you will find the JavaScript almost everywhere. You can build a mobile web app using javascript and html5, which has many advantages such as avoiding licensing fees of $99 per year to compensate the Apple for creating IOS applications, and you don't have to purchase a MAC laptop to develop your IOS application (Apple's software can only be built in MAC).

Web technology has been stormed by JavaScript, and small software ventures to fortune 500 nowadays all use node js for web applications. Recently wordpress.com rewrote its interface in javascript, as well as updating some of its elements in java script through paypal. Javascript is essential for everyone, be it google/twitter/facebook. It is used in applications such as single-page apps, Implementation of APIs for geolocation, net advertising, etc.

Nonetheless, JavaScript has its own quirks and has dynamic/scripting/functional-oriented code. It's not scalable, it's perfect for some 3000 lines of code, but it's hard to manage, interpret and debug for a bigger device. Not everyone is acquainted with JavaScript as well.

Often you'll think that, then I don't know much about a JavaScript, "How to be a Web Developer without JavaScript knowledge?

In order to make our work easier, some smart developers/companies have created a compiler/transpiler that transforms the other language software into javascript code.

**C++:** If you know C++, you can convert it to JavaScript. Cheerp is a free compiler for corporate open-source projects as well as non-commercial closed-source applications. It is the internet-based C++ compiler. Simply create a web application or port a current one, all in C++. Cheerp generates its JavaScript code that can be executed on any browser.

**Java:** It is an open source enthusiast with the help of Oracle/IBM/Google/Red hat. Java programmers are the maximum number of developers in the world (around 10 million). Maximum number of projects is focused on Java in github and apache.

* **GWT:** It is a design toolkit for dynamic browser-based software construction and optimization. The aim is to allow high-performance web applications to be successful without the programmer being an expert in interface glitches, XMLHttpRequest, and JavaScript. It's online, open source, and is used by thousands of developers around the globe.
* **JSweet:** A Java toTypeScript/JavaScript transpiler which includes more than 1000 well-typed JavaScript libraries from Java.
* **Kotlin :** It is a programming language that operates on the Java Virtual Machine and can also be translated into source code from JavaScript. Kotlin language is not developed by Academia or Research Lab, unlike most programming languages, but it is created by a professional jetbrains agency.

**Scala:** Mix of a functional and object-oriented approach. It is a static language, but as a dynamic language, it can be used well. Scala were written in most big businesses like LinkedIn, Facebook. Once in scala you write code, and scala-js arrives to help, and the script is well compiled/transposed into javascript.

**C#:** This language is beautiful and successful. Now a days, particularly after version 4.0, it's very much like the scala language. Use bridge.net to write the software in C# and then translate it to javascript.

**Typescript:** Anders Hejlsberg's brain child, who designed Turbo, Pascal, Delphi, C#. TypeScript helps you to write JavaScript as you wish. TypeScript is a JavaScript superset that compiles to JavaScript to straightforward plain. Any browser whatsoever. Host of any kind. Any OS interface. Any Open source.
