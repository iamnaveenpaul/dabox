Writing code has always been the strongest software development task for a long period. How would you incorporate if-then-else-structure with loops to solve a business issue?

The lateral design of the user interface was achieved. The determining factor was the developer. What the program looked like what he/she was able to build. Some programmers had their user interfaces talent. Some didn't.

This has improved with the Internet's growth. Many focused on graphical user interfaces. Most specifically, there was no need to configure such user interfaces. The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) made it possible to create websites by designers. Such developers have been skilled in the technical field. Obviously. Yet they didn't have to be developers.

JavaScript was not mandatory at that moment. Not long ago, I worked with renowned "front-end" developers. In those who do HTML and CSS for graphic design (only). And in those who can work with JavaScript to some extent.

The development of JavaScript was a hacky concept. The Document Object Model (DOM) was manipulated by front-end programmers. That's the HTML-elements hierarchical structure of the page. They added, removed, and changed an HTML-element's classes and other attributes. From a software engineer's eyes, all of this was hacky! It had nothing to do with the software engineering expertise.

Would you let your business logic being implemented by a JavaScript developer? Will you allow him/her to do anything that you think is critical to your business success?

Hell no!!

It was left to the back-end programmers to apply business logic. Such developers took and incorporated the modeled HTML into the business logic they created. PHP was famous to allow HTML on the server side relatively easy to create.

But there was something going on!

Probably due to the advent of HTML5 and "JavaScript and XML asynchronous" (AJAX). Perhaps triggered by Ecma Script's inception. Websites began to act and feel more like applications. The user interface was closely linked to an increasing proportion of the business logic. Frameworks emerged in JavaScript for a greater responsibility. Developers at the front-end level have shed their hacky reputation and have also become software engineers.

Software engineering has allegedly gotten itself into much more front-end development than back-end development is today, so much so that it is practically visible! Back-end has been reduced to working with databases, providing data via APIs, and taking care of DevOps. They deal with all of the interconnectivity and integration criteria. Sometimes working with various APIs is... hacky! They need to make sure all the specifics are going to work together. Specific code is built for a very specific API.

Yet shifting the business logic to the front end did not release the back-end capability. All the reasoning still had to operate on the server side for plausibility, protection, and integrity. Because hackers might change the front-end. It became necessary to replicate the code.

Coding, of course, comes with concerns if written twice. Twice, there's the preventable attempt of doing stuff. And there is the possibility of conflicts between front-end and back-end rationale.

Full-stack development offers to avoid duplicating code and eliminate such inconsistencies.

There's a fair chance of keeping this vow.

On any modern browser, JavaScript continues to run. It also runs on the server with Node.js.

The barriers and constrains between HTML and JavaScript are eliminated by [React.js](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=https://reactjs.org/). It uses the Javascript Syntax Extension (JSX) which complements HTML to the basic source code of Javascript.

[Styled-Components](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=https://www.styled-components.com) provided a convenient way to customize the components of the React. So, Global style sheets are no longer needed.

You can write [REST-services](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=https://codeburst.io/how-to-create-a-service-oriented-react-web-app-2770f41a43d8) as well as [database schemes and queries](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=https://codeburst.io/data-driven-react-with-apollo-dynamodb-and-infrastructure-components-a23ebbe8f98b) with [Infrastructure-Components](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=/). You could even configure your infrastructure without a server.

The React.js stack (including libraries) occupies almost the whole stack of software.

Instead, you could use React to both the back-end and even DevOps from the very front-end of your software. Inside the same script, of course. And there would be no duplicates.

The stack of technology has never been so uniform. From such an angle, becoming a full-stack programmer has not been been so simpler and easier before.

With both the technology stack inching closer around each other, there is even greater demand for full-stack developers. Think isomorphic React applications. These are programs that operate on the server and on the client side using the same React-components. When you found yourself to be either a mere front-end developer or a back-end one, the task would not be upto the standards of struggle.

This is less of an obstacle for coding. It's not about mastering several different languages in programming. This is a struggle to the skills and the way of thinking.

It needs more than HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct user interfaces that are intuitive. You need the ability to craft compelling experiences with users.

This requires more than mixing if-then-else-structures and loops to create business logic. You need to grasp your logic's ramifications.

You need to consider software architectures while developing full-stack applications. You need to consider how the software can be composed. Your front-end and back-end code may be the same. But [whether the code is running on the front-end or at the back-end is important](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=https://codeburst.io/do-you-want-to-become-a-full-stack-developer-e532dd2b7714) to know. It is critical for efficiency, security, and even have the capability to make sense at times.

The desire for full-stack developers no longer derives from the temptation of the businessmen to recruit less developers who can do more. The need for full-stack programmers emerges from the tools growing power. React is no longer a library at the front end. Today, in [composing back-end code](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=https://codeburst.io/how-to-create-a-service-oriented-react-web-app-2770f41a43d8) and [configuring your infrastructure](https://www.infrastructure-components.com/page?ref=medium_whyfullstack&dest=/), you can also use React.

Multiple programming languages are no longer needed for the growth in the full-stack field. Yet flexible skills are still expected. You need to act and think as a full-stack developer.
