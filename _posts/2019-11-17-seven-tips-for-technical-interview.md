I completed my graduation from PES Bangalore in 2015, I had no experience for programming at the industry level nor I was employed in one. It was time to hunt for jobs and It had been quite a lot of struggling and a bit stressful for me, after 30 days of searching in March, I was employed as a full stack engineer in a startup company called Relatas and secured my job permanently there in July.

But as I remember more and more about the time I graduated, from searching for jobs till getting one, I would’ve wished at that time that I knew more about some things, but there were other things that paid off really well more than I expected. Now to save those stressful times I had, I would like to provide 7 key things that would secure your job you might yearn for:

**1. Make a portfolio of a few standout projects**

I’ve gone through some of my classmate’s portfolio where they have at least one or two but partially completed projects and it is fine to be that way, because they somehow reflected their progress as a programmer. My dozenal solstice calendar was glitchy too.

This means if you know React, you should atleast have a react app project. You should’ve at least three projects in your portfolio if you are not experienced in any job as a software engineer. Don’t go with the tutorials. Be creative, take an interest in your own project you like like I did with my own calendar, at least you have something fun while describing it than monotonously describing some other projects that you would have least interested in, and the interviewer would be happy to see something you’ve done you liked passionately, and the more you like something, you put more effort into it including the minor details. It’s even better if you have your portfolio website or an app to it.

You should be able to tell the strengths and weaknesses at the key areas while you were developing the project, I had my project at Github and I recommend others have it too. While interviewing, some of them asked me through for an explanation at the codes, and I was getting some areas of the code unknown to me for a reason I forgot, but I was able to catch it up on the fly. The reason was that it had been a while since I looked at the code. So, you have to be prepared. My interviewer also looked up at the Git commit history to see the progress through I’ve been made at the time, and he was impressed, even though I made a lot of mistakes but good commit messages. So, I recommend familiarizing yourself with Git+ and Github, and if you are not familiar with it, you should make your first PR to an open source project.

**2. Prepare for the technical interview**

There are a lot of ways to improve and I am going to specify a few, there are lots of problems with the tech interviewing but many companies do whiteboarding, there are resources to practice it like Pramp, InterviewCake, Cracking the Code Interview, and others.

I like to say that I struggle a lot, my mind would go completely blank under some pressure. The key here is to think and practise out loud, which works by the way. Complete utter silence is the last thing you want in an interview and the more you think out loud, the better of you will reflect and the interviewer would know how far you’ve gotten and he may be able to help you out if they want.

There are a lot of technical questions that are asked which you can find the sources online, I’ve always kept the whiteboard to write the code from scratch without any help from code editor, which helps a lot, as they have whiteboard in most interviews as well. Not all of them, but it’s tough suddenly to go from code editor to whiteboard. All companies will ask you some basic technical questions, for me, it was for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and they asked me questions such as how to improve load times of a website, the css box model and specificity weights, event loop in js, promises and async/await, and I’ve been asked those a lot of times.

**3. Define what kind of company or role you want**

Keep in mind the type of job you want, because you are going to provide the majority of your time for work and if you are not excited about it later, what’s the point of doing it?

Setting a list of priorities for the job will help you stay dominated for your job hunt instead of running out of it. My first priority was to have a job where there is opportunity for learning and solving challenging problems that interest me, and along with that, I prefer working on the modern tech stack. All this was important but also, a good work-life balance is also important.

Keeping these priorities in mind, I was successfully able to enroll into one, where there was good healthy work culture, there were no night shifts or working at weekends. I found working on new platforms and frameworks and where I felt sorry for jquery.

Also, the most important thing to say here is the interview is just not for the company to evaluate you. It could work the same way to evaluate the company by you, to some extent, that helps you find the warning signs if the company is bad or fit for you.

I have been to Interview for a company where they issued a long list of a challenging, problematic code before even speaking with the candidates. The other one where when I mentioned my priority for a good work-life balance seemingly backfired, there were others like these. Make a habit of asking questions in an interview as well, which makes the interviewer seem that you are serious and interested. This also helps you detect the warning signs as I described above, as to why not choose the company which doesn’t satisfy your priority.

**4. Stay organized and track everything**

Often you find that you have awesome projects and are prepared to crack any interview and get the job that you like, but managing those and dozens of files and apps could be frustrating, they become cumbersome in your computer folder. I found the Airtable quite helpful in this regard, which I was able to manage my applications, files, projects, email offers with the salary ranges, contact numbers, schedules, type of companies more. It’s like more advanced than google spreadsheets and docs.

The following chart is the details of the response of the job and its state afterwards:

Out of total 50 job applications. ‘Declined’ means that I ignored for the interview. ‘Rejections’ means that the company rejected me for the job.

It’s not too bad and too good either considering the way I took approach for job listing, as you can see, I got no response from almost half of the offers. But if we take a look at the jobs that I had an opportunity to interview for:

Out of 18 positions, I got 9 offers, ‘declined’ interviewing for 3 positions, got rejection from 1. I was between interviews for 6 companies when I accepted another job.

I got the offer which I accepted for one before proceeding for further more interviews, it’s better that my rate of offer is 50%, I was in between rounds when I got that job so who knows, if I continued interviewing others, they might’ve turned into offers. The one that I got rejected was awkward, and the rejection seemed likely because they said they had 60+ hrs of workrate per week on average and I laughed out loud for that.

Thanks to the spreadsheet I’ve been using to research and develop strategy. I was getting good at interviewing game but the ability to get that interview was not so good. And because I already got a job, I wish that I still had time of some few more months to play this game, I would have better data with new improved strategy with cutting out time on application and cover letters and more time on cultivating referrals and networking.

**5. Write a meaningful resume and cover letter**

Keep your resume short and clear, those that are more than one page or typos or grammatical mistakes often gets rejected. Spend more time in high quality applications than lots of writing for low ones. Take some time to read about the company and find your reasons as to why you want to join it, maybe you might not find any reason and the company isn’t right for you. Generic cover letters are good but they don’t help you much either.

Avoid simply copy pasting templates online, the managers might google it. Use the correct profile for any previous jobs that you have, I worked in a fundraising company which has nothing to do with web development but I made sure I highlighted my technical projects on the top part of my resume, making my technical aspect to appear first before my job history.

**6. Network!**

Make yourself good at networking even though you’re terrible at it. It seems it doesn’t help but it might get paid off more than you think. I was shy too, an introvert where I was not good at multitasking and mingling in large group settings, but I made it possible, It didn’t lead me to any more open to jobs or job leads but I found one that I learned through meeting up with someone.

There are lots of jobs out there who don’t make themselves visible, and they can be your kind of best jobs that you can have, so you have to build your professional network even if you are an amateur to industry. This is beneficial to others who refer you as well, because they get referral bonuses from their companies, so they are equally interested to help you out.

**7. Avoid settling for less, and negotiate, negotiate, negotiate**

As I was interviewing, I never thought of what to expect as a salary, there are a lot of online salary estimates websites like Payscale where I used it and took salary survey at my local techie meet-up. Also, you don’t want to interview for a company that expects a salary par below your expectations, and mind that all companies will ask your salary expectation. The first one to provide a number is in a weaker position for negotiations anyhow. I did the same and researched my salary number that I need to provide at my level of expertise, and compared that with the average salary for my profession depending upon my experience. You want your base expectation to be starting from say x to y range where you are even satisfied with the lower range, there are websites like Glassdoor where for large scale companies, you range would align more or less with theirs.

But money was not the most important thing for a job, my primary requirement was to have an environment where you can contribute to the company but at the same time, have a platform for my personal growth where I can learn and learn more which makes the job more purposeful in life. This was my polite way of saying them too, to express my negotiation and made sure that my bottom range of my salary range would be something I could be happy with. Never be afraid to negotiate, sometimes you can do the negotiation with other things than salary which is more flexible, such as taking vacations, bonusus and incentives etc.

**Conclusion**

It was a good feeling describing about my experiences and I am glad that you could make it till the end and found it helpful for your job hunt. I am sure that if you are qualified and are prepared for Interview, you will surely get any job, even outside major tech companies. There is a lot of demand out there for software engineers and you just need to concentrate on what job you want to have.

You might need a job where you like the environment and with a good salary and you want to work in a role that involves working on technologies that you love to have working with and at the company that treats its employees well. It might not be possible to get it all at your first tech job, but at least you step a foot in your career, your further opportunity awaits you and it will get better and better.

Good luck, take care of yourself, enjoy the struggles and learn the way of life!
