And due to the large number of people referring e-learning sites they tend to share their resources to make it available for every common person.

1. Coursera: Coursera has partnered with museums, universities, and other institutions to offer students free classes on an astounding variety of topics. Students can browse the list of available topics or simply answer the question "What would you like to learn about?", then when they answer that question they are led to a list of available courses on that topic. Students who are nervous about getting in over their heads can relax.
2. edX: edX is a massive open online course provider. It hosts online university-level courses in a wide range of disciplines to a worldwide student body, including some courses at no charge.
3. Khan Academy: Khan Academy doesn't get top billing due to its popularity. Sal Khan and his team have earned their place by creating self-paced, free, source of online education that has become an industry standard. Khan academy provides an easy path for students to jump in and begin learning about any subject that they choose.
4. Academic Earth: It probably brings the most unique concept of education that there is. This is the idea that education should be accessible worldwide. This level of access is convenient for many students, but potentially lifesaving for students in underprivileged areas.

Not only are there motivational speakers on Ted, there are also topical videos, often less than ten minutes each that are full of important information.

Above mentioned points are not based on ranking but placed randomly. Mostly they are kept based on their popularity and type of content available.
