The main goal of this article is to make anyone capable to learn and be prepared for programming, and available to everyone.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

As a mentor, I am constantly asked the following:
“If I am a newbie at programming, Which language should I learn?”
“Which programming language is most demand in terms of jobs?”
“Which programming language is the most popular?”

**Top Programming Languages**

If you are searching for an official list of the top programming languages, you will find it [here](https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2017).

I don't recommend that you choose a language based on a list alone, if you're new to programming though. That list is great to check whether a specific programming language is currently in use.

**How to choose a programming language?**

Computer science is a research area that is largely cumulative. Which implies that each successive topic is based on previous topics.
You've tried to learn programming (or any STEM field) in school before, you might've tried your best, but failed but it wasn’t your fault. The program is carefully curated by a good professor of any combined subject. The requirements for the prior knowledge of the students should be transparent provided that each student has properly studied and fulfilled the prerequisites. A good teacher knows the standards and does not presume any expertise beyond that context. It is necessary to teach anything beyond expectations. Each subject in the curriculum is ordered sequentially, depending on the other subjects.

The development of a curriculum or learning path needs meticulous attention, when a subject is cumulative. Having said that, do not choose a language for its ranking but rather choose a language for which you have a complete path of learning that does not make impressions about whatever knowledge that you had beforehand.

**A few words of advice**

Everything in computer science is progressive. It's important to focus on the point I made above before you start learning to code.
The biggest mistake you can make is giving up because you don't think you're smart enough to learn programming. I like to restate this again because as an aspiring programmer, It has nothing to do with your intellect to learn to code. Yes, programming is hard to learn, not because of who you are, but because you need to learn a lot of topics.

First assumed rule, agree the following scenario will happen: you're introduced to a new subject that doesn't make any sense to you.
This situation will repeat itself with time. Whether you can(not) manage this scenario is the only thing deciding your performance and success any time it happens.

If it doesn't make sense to you to remain with the current topic you are learning. Don't go to the next topic. The topics are cumulative, to reiterate. Skipping forward is like trying to attach a roof to a house without a frame, walls, and foundation.

In this situation that I find myself constantly, I sometimes need to rewatch many times the same reading in a video tutorial to grasp what I am doing. When you find yourself in my shoes, don't get discouraged.

You have to find other resources that work for you if the tutorial (or book) you are using didn't help explaining the issue enough. That is no excuse to give up simply because a coverage of some topics of your tutorial did not work for you. You will find many resources everything you want to know, especially YouTube.

Check the statistics first when you are finding educational tutorials on YouTube. Find out what you are looking for (for example [the topic] in [your programming language] + any other useful keywords). See the rating or the number of views. Read a few of the comments to test your views, if you still don't know if that a video is actually worth your time.

A lot of things aren’t going to make any sense if you are familiarizing it for the first time. So, refrain from any self developing negative thoughts.

The objective is to be aware of your understanding as you learn. You need to reflect on yourself as you advance through the learning path. Ask yourself questions for each subject you discuss, for example:

“Does this topic making any sense to me?”

“Has a new terminology existed? If so, was each new term explicitly defined??”

“Have there been any existing competencies? Will I know how to implement any new skill? Can I show my understanding by solving problems with practice?”

“Will I remind myself of tomorrow's learning? And the following day? If not, how will I put it in memory?”

One last tip: never underestimate the memorization capacity. Memorization is an approach to education which is totally underused. Yeah, the ultimate goal is to understand a topic. Understanding can take time, however. If you really have difficulties understanding an issue, break it down and memorize the key words. You must memorize quickly if you can not grasp how something functions.
Try using the research card method if you need guidance on how to handle memorization. You can read more about [here](https://goo.gl/VqX1Dt) on how to use this technique.

**1 — Computer Science Fundamentals**

The first move is to learn the basics of computer science, which is discussed in [this](https://codeburst.io/intro-to-computer-science-terminology-f9ae64e75d27) article, which seems easy to comprehend for even those people without any background skills in computers.

The topics discussed by the journal were largely conclusive. You can read the article quickly, and that's great enough for you. I request that these words be committed to memory. Approach every term as if you're in school and you need to remember the definitions of each term for an examination. If you don't want to, you don't have to dedicate yourself too carefully. Nevertheless, the more you can devote to memory, the simpler the latter concepts are to be interpreted.

**2 — Propositional Logic (optional)**

To be a programmer, you need not be strong in math. Math knowledge can be helpful, but it is not a necessity.

I recommend learning proposal logic if you are unsure about your mathematical abilities. The basic elements of programming are the principles covered by propositional logic.

You can learn propositional logic from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV4htTfow-E&list=PL619166130C21EADA) YouTube tutorial.

**3 — Java Programming**

You will be ready to learn a programming language after learning the basics of computer science.

In creating a direction appropriate for everyone, in whatever contextual ability you can assume for yourself, I have placed much thoughts and efforts in choosing Java as a learning route. Java is the language I have most learned.

Java is one of the most in-demand programming languages. It’s classified as an object-oriented programming language (more on this terminology explained later) and it’s used to make desktop, web, and mobile applications.

I suggest [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009208/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=programmr-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0596009208&linkId=368b405d998039a5dd14aa263621518e) if you want to know from a book.

I recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBWX97e1E9g&list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) video tutorial #1–19, 31, 33, 88 and 93 from Derek Banas.

The first video redirects you to download a computer program called Eclipse. Eclipse is an integrated design environment (IDE). It is an advanced technology system. You may call an IDE a nice expression for a programmer's word editor. It is just a computer application that provides a programming text editor with other software tools. You can learn installing Eclipse [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svJQu6LUSTs&index=92&list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19&t=201s), the link to the video from Derek Banas's YouTube.

**4 — Algorithms and Data Structures**

An algorithm is a set of instructions (or steps) to carry out a task in which each step must be clearly defined, capable of execution and isn’t endless (finite i.e. does not carry on with infinite execution).

A data structure is a way to organize memory data.

Two of the most challenging programming topics are algorithms and data structures. You don't have to learn basic computer or competency ability algorithms. Nonetheless, you will be able to demonstrate an appreciation of formulas and information models during the interviews if you plan to serve as a software engineer in a prestigious technology company.

Watch the [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/break-away-coding-interviews-1/?couponCode=PROGRAMM.R) on algorithms and data structures by Udemy. This was by far seems the most comprehensive tutorial for your success, whether you want to learn algorithms and data structures or prepare for technical interviews.

Next to the tutorial I consider using the [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en),  a free resource showing how values change during the execution of the algorithm.

**5— Android development**

In my view, Android design is one of Java's most enjoyable applications. Android apps are mostly coded in Java, so you will be willing to learn It when you know Java.

[Here](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud834) is the best free Android video tutorial.

You have a few choices to go from there after finishing the Udacity course described above, which by the way should be extended by the Google employees of the same group. Once you get through the course (if you can't find it, check for it in Udacity), the additional lectures should become available. Especially because it is free, this seems a good option.

I recommend [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491974052/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=programmr-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1491974052&linkId=c8ecae3a3fe023f9d2fea94a51aaa8a6), a brain-friendly guide if you are willing to spend money on a good book. The book provides comprehensive explanations and useful visual approach to help you better think about Android's underlying concepts. You follow a sample request in every section. Everything is described clearly, using vocabulary or diagrams for anyone to learn.

**Helpful Resources**

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a platform that helps developers to access free software support, search for it first, especially if you get stuck and want to ask a question. If your question can not be found, please create an account and post your question!

There are a number of educational websites where tutorials can be found. I like the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), and [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).
