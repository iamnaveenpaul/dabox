Government job or private job? This question worries every young and aspiring candidate who is in his/her final year of his bachelor’s degree and are about to enter a new phase in their life. 

Selection for government job is done via common test which is conducted online now a days. Every year many candidates apply for exams to fulfill their dreams. Every year candidates apply for government jobs in crores. A report by the Times of India newspaper stated that over 2.8 crore candidates applied for 90 thousand railway jobs. Where as India’s IT sector created 8.73 lakh jobs in the last five years - NASSCOM. Though government jobs seem attractive and have advantages but these jobs also have disadvantages too. One of my friends had cleared the government recruitment process and he was posted in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kerala. Though he was happy but part of his heart was sunk that he was very far away from his family and friends. So, your posting may be anywhere in India, maybe small town or village. On top of that in India Govt office infrastructure and environment are not conducive for light hearted. Work is not challenging and probably your personal growth may be hampered and the hidden potential could be wasted. 

The competition for government jobs is immense and chances of getting selected are glimmer. Perseverance for getting into government sector is a good thing but not at the cost of time and experience wasted in years. There are thousands of startups coming up every year so there is no dearth of jobs in the IT sector. 

Salary and security becomes one of the important criteria to take up the job.

The government sector has benefits such as pensions, concessions for using government facilities and others like medical facilities. The private sector too has benefits but slightly in a different way, While salaries in government sector has been increasing but has not kept pace with the private sector. Michael Page, a recruiting firm published a report stating the average salary increase in various sectors:

* Sales and marketing — 21-25%
* Finance and accounting — 21-30
* Legal — 26-30%
* Engineering and manufacturing — 23%
* Technology — 26-30%
* Digital & analytics — 31-35%

Recently Willis Tower Watson, a global advisory, broking and solutions company also published a  Survey report which says that India Inc to see a 10% salary increase in 2020. According to the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), a non-profit industry association, India’s IT sector created 8.73 lakh jobs in the last five years. One of the report by NASSCOM also states that India is the world’s third largest tech startup hub, with over 7,000 product and services based startups. There are companies which have reached valuation of $1 Billion, they are known as Unicorn. As per Business Standard in 2018  there were 8 new startups that have joined the Unicorn club totalling to 27. Many companies among these do not use deep tech yet. Deep tech startups are those that are based on substantial scientific advances and high-tech engineering innovation. Deep tech is growing at 50% annually, overall digital is growing at 30% and valued at $33 billion. So there is immense opportunity ahead. It is the right time to have some tech stuff/tools up your sleeve.

Salary is important as long you are satisfied with the nature of work. If one wants to know about the type of work one gets to do in government organisations is similar to factory job, you do the same repetitive process everyday unless you are promoted are assigned some challenging tasks. Over a period of time you are kind of bored doing the same job day in and day out. It is also tough to show  and prove your creative ability as the decision-making hierarchy will barely notice your creativity. The private sector has a much better culture of work and your creativity is put to work. You face challenging tasks everyday and you improve on a daily basis. The more creative you are the more opportunity to grow. 

There is also this myth about the work pressure in both government and private sectors. Both the government sector and private sector have subtle difference, in the case of former the workload is evenly distributed where as in the private sector workload is distributed based on your previous contribution.

More important is to focus on where you want to be in 10 years down the lane. Either government or private sector whichever suits you, you still need to climb the mountain with all your heart. It is you who is going to choose and make your own path. You yourself will be responsible for setting your goal and career path. Now that you are aware, the ball is in your court. Get out of comfort and make your choice.
