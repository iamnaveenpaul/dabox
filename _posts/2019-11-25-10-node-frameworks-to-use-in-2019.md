To build more applications especially for the web, more developers have switched to using JavaScript. To promote the rapid prototyping and development of awesome projects, this has resulted in an exponential growth in the use of frameworks specifically built for the JavaScript community.

Node.js is a JavaScript platform that executes the JS code outside browser and lets developers write command line tools and for server-side scripting to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the browser. It represents a “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server and client side scripts.

Developed by Linux, it is a general programming language that aims to optimize scalability with many operations, real time web applications and building quick network applications, making development more consistent and designed within the same system by leveraging JS on both front and back end.

There were many advantages, including but not limited to the use of event-driven non-blocking input/output model, asynchronous single-threaded programming among others, when the Node.js was introduced to the tech community in 2009 as a tool for building scalable server-side web applications.

The fact that you can conveniently use the same language as a programmer for both client-side and server-side scripting has improved rapid adoption and rapid node use.

A lot of experienced JavaScript developers have developed quite a few amazing frameworks over the years to get started quickly with Node.js while creating web applications.

When we look into 2019, I'm going to list some of the most common Node.js frameworks that you should consider using regardless of size to create web applications.

**What is a Node framework?**

A framework for Node.js is almost like the skeleton of a program that makes up the customized codes that you write as the meat that completes the program, as it’s just some conceptual model, developed from Node.js, which represents the control flow of the layout of the provided system.

There would be some standard implementation specific to the framework for each Node.js function, which would then allow the client to follow the framework's lead by adding more codes to describe their use case.

**Benefits of Node frameworks**

Because of their speed, productivity and scalability, node.js frameworks are mostly used and making them one of the first choice for companies to build business applications.

Node.js saves you the hassle of learning a new language for a simple application and allowing you to retain the same style of programming throughout as it helps you to write the same language for both your front-end and backend.

You can work with a set of tools, guidelines and best activities to help you save time by using a system by using a framework. It can also help to strengthen software quality programming across developers.

**Selecting a Node Framework**

Because we choose a feature based on what we like, Selecting a framework can be a bit tricky and subjective to pick a system for its use case. GitHub stars helps ranging from application weight, speed, usability, learning curve, versatility and configuration, use case, or even popularity in some cases.

Next, let's take a deep dive into this post's purpose and go through the Node.js frameworks list that will help boost your productivity by building JavaScript apps, especially on the server side.

We're going to be organizing by what we saw on Scotch.io as popular as stars aren't everything.

**1. [AdonisJs [GitHub Stars: 5,053]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-1-adonisjs-github-stars-5-053-)**

[AdonisJs](https://adonisjs.com/) is a Node.js framework. From the official documentation, "AdonisJs is a Node.js MVC framework that runs on all major operating systems. It offers a stable ecosystem to write a server-side web application so that you can focus on business needs over finalising which package to choose or not. AdonisJs favors developer joy with a consistent and expressive API to build full-stack web applications or micro API servers."

Adonis is billed as the Node's Laravel. Simplicity and focus on doing things.

"We're big fans of Laravel's approach (Scotch is built on Laravel) so when we saw those same principles come to the Node side, we were very excited." - [Chris Sevilleja](https://twitter.com/chrisoncode)

**Why AdonisJS?**

AdonisJs has an ORM support with SQL-databases (PostgreSQL) in mind. This generates productive SQL-questions and is based on the idea of active recording. The query builder is easy to learn and enables us to quickly create simple queries.

AdonisJs, like MongoDB, also has good support for No-SQL database. It's very close to Laravel's MVC architecture, so AdonisJs will be very easy if you've used Laravel for web development.

To get started, check out Chimezie's article on scotch.io [here](https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-web-app-with-adonisjs).

**2. [Express.js [GitHub Stars: 41,036]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-2-express-js-github-stars-41-036-)**

Express.js is a web framework for Node.js that is quick, minimalist and non-opinionated. It's just a Node.js-based technology that functions like a middleware to help manage our databases and routes. The ability to build a lightweight application that can handle more than one request seamlessly depends on the ability to serve technologies such as express, as by looking at the asynchronous nature of Node.js and the fact that Express.js was built on the node,.

A major benefit with express is how it supports many other packages and prototype engines like Pug, Mustache, EJS and much more. The flexible API allows users to configure routes between the front-end and the database to send/receive requests (acting as a platform for HTTP servers).

Some of the advantages of Express.js are:

* Nearly the standard web middleware for Node.js
* Totally customisable
* Low learning curve
* Mostly focused on browsers, making it an almost out of the box feature to template and render.

With over 41,000 stars [ Github stars: 41,036 ], it is probably the most popular Node.js framework available for the JavaScript community on GitHub. Over time, Express.js has shown that its popularity with its easy to use methods and functions is worth the hype.

I don't see it going off anytime soon, looking at this framework and all it's exciting abilities.

**3. [Meteor.js [GitHub Stars: 40,490]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-3-meteor-js-github-stars-40-490-)**

The main advantage of Meteor docs is that it is updated in real time. As the web app changes, it updates the model automatically with the latest changes. The Meteor docs define meteor as a JavaScript full-stack platform for the development of modern web and mobile applications.

The Node.js framework makes it work just as well on the server side as on the client side by simplifying development by providing a platform to be in the same JavaScript language for the entire tier of the application.

Large-scale projects such as reaction trade which is known as one of the largest and most popular open source e-commerce projects, where Meteor has the capacity to support  it.

Meteor framework helps users learn very quickly by going out and getting their hands dirty with projects, as its most interesting thing is that it has a very rich and structured documentation/large community for it.

If there is any Node.js frameworks list to look out for, I might be arrested if I didn't add Meteor to that list, because meteor leverages the Facebook GraphQL datastack to develop meteor Apollo as far back as 2016, it only indicates that they have good plans and a visionary perception of what the future holds for data on how it is managed and how it flows.

**4. [Nest.js [GitHub Stars: 10,128]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-4-nest-js-github-stars-10-128-)**

As Nest uses progressive JavaScript and is written using TypeScript. So, Nest comes with fast typing, combining elements of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming), FP(Functional Programming) and FRP(Functional Reactive Programming). NestJs is a platform developed with Node.js, which is used to create server-side applications that are powerful and scalable Node.js.

Nest also uses Express, offering an architecture out of the box that enables highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications to be built without effort.

With many features out of the box, Nest CLI can be used to create nest.js applications. Well I suppose it's cool, and I hope this should also make it look out for in 2019 in the list of Node.js frameworks because you can contact the nest group of developers behind the nest platform to find out more about expertise consulting, on-site business support, coaching, and private sessions, according to the website.

**5. [Sails.js [GitHub Stars: 19,887]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-5-sails-js-github-stars-19-887-)**

[Sails](https://sailsjs.com/) is another Node.js platform used to build custom Node.js applications. With a flexible service-oriented architecture, the APIs are data-driven. And it boasts the most common MVC Node.js platform with support for the requirements of modern apps.

Sails are bundling an ORM, waterlines, which enables compatibility with nearly all databases, going as far as providing a huge number of community projects. Some of the adapters it officially supports include MYSQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Mongo and even Local Disk.

Just by running an installation command for instance, ‘sails generate api bookstore’, without you writing any codes at all, it’s surprising that provides you some basic blueprints in the backend.

It provides you CRUD bookstore endpoints with commands. Sails is also compatible with nearly all frontend technologies ranging from React, Angular, Backbone, Android/java, iOS/objective C, Windows phone and possibly even some technologies that still need to be created. It's 2019 for this one included and in the review are:

* Many automated generators.
* No additional routing required.
* Transparent Websockets support.
* Good integration of the frontend with other frontend technologies.
* Due to its waterline ORM, it is compatible with almost all databases.
* Enables faster REST API development.

**6. [Koa.js [GitHub Stars: 23,902]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-6-koa-js-github-stars-23-902-)**

Koa was created by the same team that created Express.js, making it appear as if it was picking up from where it left off expressly. Referred to as Node.js' next-generation web framework, Koa is different in that it uses some really cool ECMAScript(ES6) methods that haven't even landed in some browsers yet, allowing you to work without callbacks while also giving you a huge increase in error handling. It requires at least 0.11 or higher version of Node.js.

Koa does not bundle any middleware within the heart (core) of it, meaning the middleware (based on components) is more cascaded/streamlined, and each line of code is quite elegant and granular, allowing you to arrange the parts as you like. It makes the system more setup and handling control, according to their website.

Koa was future-proof because the holy grail of asynchronous programming or functionality of Callbacks that can potentially be dissolved.

Some key features include:

* Efficient error handling
* Ditched callbacks hell
* Cascading middlewares
* Component-based building blocks
* Pretty modular

I'm almost beginning to see that if an article comes out for frameworks to be looked for in 2020, it would probably still make the list as this is definitely a framework for the future.

**7. [LoopBack.js [GitHub Stars: 11,985]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-7-loopback-js-github-stars-11-985-)**

An another Node.js framework with a user-friendly CLI and a dynamic explorer API. In the absence of a schema, it enables you to create your models based on your schema or dynamic models. It is compatible with a wide variety of REST services and servers like MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Oracle and so on.

It has the ability to allow a client to create a database API that will connect to another application, almost like a proxy for another API. To clients like Android/Java, iOS, javaScript(Angular) browser, it is support to native mobile and web SDKs.

Key features:

* [Set up dynamic end-to-end REST APIs quickly](https://loopback.io/#core).
* [Connect data and services to devices and browsers](https://loopback.io/#juggler)
* To easily create client apps by using [Android, iOS and AngularJS SDKs](https://loopback.io/#sdks).
* [Add-on file management modules](https://loopback.io/#components), third party authentication, and OAuth2.
* Runs on board or in the cloud.

I found very interesting to go through this information and even try to get a simple setup, as most of these were gathered from their website / documentation which, showing that they have a well-structured documentation and a community spread through different media (StrongLoop blog, LoopBack Google Group, LoopBack Gitter channel). The Loopback website, for example, offers several tutorials and uses cases to maximize the use of software in various ways.

Go Daddy, Symantec, Flight Office, ShoppinPal, Bank of America(Meryll Linch), Intellum are some of its powerful users.

**8. [Hapi.js [GitHub Stars: 10,371]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-8-hapi-js-github-stars-10-371-)**

[Hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/resources) is a pretty good replacement for Express, although both of them have unique features. Like ExpressJs, the common hapi.js, supported by Walmart Labs is a framework for Node.js which helps to serve data by intermediating between the server side and client side.

Hapi is a pattern driven by configuration, typically designed to manage web server operations. A unique feature that it has is the ability to create a server on a specific IP, with features such as the 'onPreHandler', where we can do something with a request before it is completed by intercepting it and pre-processing the request.

The ‘handler’ behaves like a pseudo-middleware from what we see, because it's controller feature where we can call a route while making the requests and still move some parameters to get the function to do something specified in the configuration.

Let's look at some of the key features that makes hapiJs:

* There is a greater control over the handling of requests.
* Detailed reference to the API and good document generation support.
* Has more features to build web servers.
* Some sub-middleware (pseudo-middleware) configuration-based approach.
* Provides caching, authentication and validation of input.
* Has a plugin-based scaling architecture.
* Provides you with really good enterprise plugins such as tv, travelogue, catbox, joi, yar, boom, etc.

HapiJs does not appear that it will soon slow down its mark and relevance. It may not be as popular as Express [github stars: 10,371] but it has some good backup and it seems to gain some grounds as well.

**9. [Derby.js [4,350]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-9-derby-js-4-350-)**

It's a full stack node.js platform for writing modern web applications, according to the official [Derby.js](https://derbyjs.com/) site. Derby was around for a while, long enough to prove hoping into 2019.

DerbyJs allows you to create highly efficient web applications by inserting customised codes. It provides seamless synchronization of data between your server and client with an automatic conflict resolution powered by the operational transformation of JSON and text by [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb).

**10. [Total.js [Github stars: 3,853]](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019#toc-10-total-js-github-stars-3-853-)**

[Total.js](https://www.totaljs.com/) shows some promise by offering some insights on their website, where visitors are asked to contribute to the framework's development. It boasts a very fast Node.js development framework, requiring little maintenance, with good performance and a smooth transition to scaling. The Total.js group has been trying to get more paid partners to join them for some time so far. This is another indication that they are planning to expand and that more growth should be checked in the near future.

Total.js has some really beautiful versions, such as the Total.js Eshop, which has a user interface that is designed for mobile devices and can be downloaded from all premium members. The shop is one of the best e-commerce platforms for Node.js. This is due to its many versions of the unique content management (CMS) system.

**Conclusion**

You must have noticed that picking a framework is based on what you really want to achieve with it, if there is anything we can pick from this article.

The Node.js frameworks above simply showed us that whatever system we're searching for, there's an open and welcoming group out there to solve issues and ready to help you learn the basics of that specific framework, which is a crucial factor to look for other factors including GitHub contributors, issues, stars and so on among many others. You can find a lot more Node.js frameworks [here](http://nodeframework.com/) just for the fun of it.

Please note that based on popularity, usage and personal opinion in the JavaScript community, all the Node.js framework highlighted in this post have been selected.

I hope this post is very helpful to you. Happy coding.
