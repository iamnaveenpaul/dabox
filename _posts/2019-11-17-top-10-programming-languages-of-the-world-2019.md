**Top 10 Programming Languages of the World – 2019**

There are hundreds of software development fields that you can choose from, and you might ask the question as a newcomer, what to choose? Which ones are the best out there? Which would be the best for my career? Which ones invokes my interest so that I would have fun while doing it?

The short and simple answer is to look out first, is going by the current market trends. so where to begin with?

Going ahead, you will find a lot of programming languages that are all the best out there and are demanding so that it serves the purpose and needs of the society, there is a web development, app development, game development, mobile development and much more.

If you learn through the post, hopefully at the end of it, you will get a clear picture of which path to take and what languages you should learn that can help boost your career, interests and goals in the long run. Without much further ado, let’s get straight to our programming languages that you can do a lot more from.

**1. JavaScript**

‘JavaScript is the most popular language among developers successively for 6 years and around two-thirds of them have used the language in the past year.’

-src: [2018’s Developer survey of Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018).

There should be no doubt about JavaScript being one of the best and most popular programming languages till date, and undoubtedly the same for future dates ahead. It’s hard to imagine the line of industry where no JavaScript is used and it even seems impossible to imagine it without being used in the future. Having said that, you can’t be a better software developer without learning the basics of the language, and the software development seems impossible without it.

It is used almost everywhere but the primary focus it takes is in the applications in front end development, but it also used oftenly on the server side as well typically coupled with Node.js

Most of the major social media and other popular interactive websites out there believe that the language is user friendly as well as build development friendly which provides an easy way to create any interactive web page with fast and smooth operation one can achieve and it holds a good flexible syntax and compatibility, making the language career driven. On top of that, it is very compatible with all the major browsers out there. This is all what makes the JavaScript a preferable programming language amongst the beginners.

**2. Python**

Python is a powerful programming language, easy to read much like the modern English language, with clear and intuitive syntax and is well preferred amongst the beginners. It’s a high level language and writing the code takes less time than other programming languages, and is more preferred for jobs which are simple to do while the complex tasks are usually reserved for other languages. It has become powerful enough and it has online libraries for tasks which makes it versatile.

People who are migrated to Python are close to 42%, this is the reason that I’ve kept this on #2 instead of many surveys that kept it on #5.

One thing to note here is that it is almost similar to JavaScript, specifically the ‘object- based’ subset between the two, and the style it uses is simple in functions and variables without much class definition interrogation. It is popular in areas like machine learning and scientific computing.

If you are interested in the back-end development, then a currently popular open source framework called Django is written in that language.

**3. Java**

The first thing that comes to mind when you see the word ‘software engineer’ is the Java language, you might have heard the language more than anything else. Java as advertised is found in almost everywhere, be it your car or blu ray disc players, or mobile phones and tablets, toys or any computing machine. The aim of Java was to make the programming safe, strong, compatible, robust and able to have an interpreter written for it, supports parallelism and dynamic typing. There are no references to data for its objects external to themselves, because it’ 99% object oriented and unlike C++, it uses automatic memory allocation and garbage collection.

A programming language by Sun Microsystems for more than 20 years. It’s powerful, easy to learn, object-oriented, independent of the hardware architecture and platform and you can compile and code into any machine language with JVM (Java Virtual Machine), where you can write the code once, and be able to run it anywhere. The JVM is Platform dependent that compiles the code into the low level machine code, so has a good cross platform capability.

It is used in the world’s most popular mobile operating system, The Android. The app development of Android is so vast because of its popularity that around [90% fortune 500 companies](https://www.zipcodewilmington.com/blog/why-java-skills-matter-now-and-in-the-future) opted for making a variety of back-end applications. The Amazon web Services and Windows Azure is run by the Java data processing done by Apache Hadoop.

With such business industry at an immense interest for java applications that around 3 billion devices were already running on Java across all cross platforms 5 years ago, you can take the word that this language is all time favourite for beginners.

**4. C/CPP**

C is the parent language of almost all popular languages out there, it is very old but still not has lost its popularity today, used primarily for building high performance applications. It was introduced in the late 70’s and C++ was the most popular programming language in the world around the 90’s. C has made a strong contribution to the world of programming.

C is considered the parent language of all, some are either derived by C or inspired by it’s syntax, constructs and paradigm notably Java, C# and Objective-C. Libraries are often in C because its compilers generate efficient object code, programmers create interfaces to the library so that the routines can be used from higher level languages like Java or Python. More than a dozen powerful and popular programming languages have a syntax similar to C and all those languages itself have been borrowed from it.

C can also be used for website programming using CGI as a gateway, it is chosen over other interpreted languages because of its speed, stability and near universal availability.

Linux is based on C and is widely used in systems programming, and has low runtime demand on system’s resources and it enables programmers to create efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures useful for computationally intensive programs. It is used as an intermediate language by implementations of other languages for more portability and convenience and end user applications.

C++ is the hybrid version of C, so the preference of it over building and designing applications that are typically at the higher level. Because the coding done in C++ is type checked before the final execution, it is powerful and has more performance output compared to other typed languages, and is usually used in gaming, VR, Graphics, telephone switches, space probes etc.

**5. PHP**

PHP stands for Hypertext Processor but it was intended to be ‘personal home page’, it is a general purpose programming language originally developed for web development, the language has actually taken over around 83% of the total websites today.

It is a scripting language initially meant for web pages, it is now exclusively suited to server side web development, it generally runs on the web server, and usually creates dynamic web content and images. It is deployed in web servers, OS and Relational DBMS (Database Management Systems), it is almost free of cost, easy to build and program and simple to use. Making it an efficient choice for new programmers. It is well suited for Wordpress CMS (Content Management Systems). It’s currently ranked on #5 because of its broad range of usage.

Some specific and advanced usage of PHP offers  a well defined and documented way for writing custom extensions in C or C++, extended in the form of additional libraries increasing execution speeds and improvement room by using a true compiled language, although its usage is dropping significantly due to security issues and it downgrades the website performance that affects the loading time.

**6. Swift**

Swift is a general purpose, open source, multi-paradigm compiled programming language by Apple Inc. It uses objective C runtime library which allows C, Objective C, C++ and swift code to run within a program.
It’s a newer language out there and Swift is barely needed for redeveloping it into native Mac OS or iOS. It was influenced by Ruby and Python and was fun to use and beginners could easily learn the language. Swift is considered safer, especially in debugging, more secure and easier to read and comprehend than Objective C. Swift is basically an alternative to Objective C language that employs modern programming theory concepts and strives to present a simpler syntax.

Introduced as ‘Objective C without C’ but unlike Objective C, Swift requires less code to write and resembles more like modern English. It’s easy to learn for programmers who have learned other languages but it’s scripting language is easily expressive and enjoyable for an industry quality programming even for beginners.

Apart from all good perspectives mentioned above, Swift generally face challenges and it has limited scope and talent pool as in comparison with other open source programming languages. It is in fact not so popular as compared with other languages, research shows somewhere around 8% of developers use it, and the frequent updates have made it less stable for every new release.

**7. C# (C- Sharp)**

C-sharp is a highly powerful, general purpose, multi paradigm, objective oriented and component oriented programming language, developed by Microsoft in 2000 as a part of its .NET initiative and was later approved by ISO and other international standards. It is used in developing desktop applications and is a powerful tool for Windows 8/10 applications where it requires .NET framework to function.

The founders of Java called the C-sharp an imitation of Java further saying that it is Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted. Sun microsystems actually did not want the microsoft interface to make changes in Java, that’s the reason C# was created and resembles more to C++ in comparison.

C# is well suited for beginners and is consistent as C++. The code execution is checked before execution so spotting errors are easy as it is a statically typed language.

It is well suited to develop web and desktop applications, and also used in VR, Gaming and Graphics. The Xamarian provides tools for cross platform mobile and desktop OS using C# compiled to native code.

**8. Ruby**

Ruby is an interpreted, open source, high level, dynamic and general purpose programming language developed in Japan in the 90’s. It was designed to cater to human coding needs rather than coding needs of a machine, it was designed to for programmer productivity and fun, it has a good interface design.

It is popular by Rails full stack web framework. Being a high level language, it resembles modern English to a large extent and it has simpler rules for coding and also has a dynamically typed language, which affects its maintenance and flexibility making it a slow programming language. You can build applications with less lines of code.

**9. Objective-C**

Objective-C is a general purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its main use was by Apple for the Mac OS, iOS, and iPadOS operating systems and their APIs (application programming interfaces), but those APIs now use Swift, calling it as Objective C without C.

It was developed in the 80’s and was used by operating systems at that time. It adds features to the C programming language and for this reason, it is sometimes referred as hybrid C.

**10. SQL**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain specific programming language to operate, programming, designing, storing, programming, managing, manipulating and retrieving data held in database and RDBM (Relational data stream management system). SQL is used for structural handling of the data and keeping the data secure, safe and precise, it is also programmed to maintain the integrity of databases irrespective of its size.

If you are better in SQL, you can have better control on data exploration and effective decision making. It is generally used across database applications and web frameworks. You have to be better at C or C++ if you plan to opt for a career as a database management and SQL is far better out there with great demand and offering high pay scales.

**Conclusion!**

The software industry changes with new technologies being updated and you have to adapt to the change with even a minor update or release within the same technology. So, answering the question “what is the best programming language out there?” is hard. It’s up to you to choose your interest that you want to work with and decide what’s best in varying fields and the extent it has along with what it provides as the job quality, availability, salaries and your development in the long run. Generally the most popular and demanding ones are the way to go as your first step, but the case is not always the usual.
