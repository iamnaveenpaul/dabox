The course starts by teaching students how to substitute the conventional JPA DAO model we developed in the Spring Core course using Spring Data JPA. It continues to develop on concepts taught in the Spring Core course by showing students how to use Spring MVC command objects and how to conduct server-side property validations.

Next, we use Spring Security which is one of the Spring Framework's most widely used modules.

It shows how our existing Spring MVC web application can be added to Spring Security. We configure Spring Security to read our database user information and then secure URLs with specific security roles for authenticated users.

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a popular programming paradigm and the Spring Framework supports it. In the AOP section, you'll learn on how to use AOP for Spring Security login activity We don't have to modify any of the Spring Security code by using AOP.

The Spring Framework has a very comprehensive framework of events that we can use for application events. You'll learn on how to build a custom app event, then set up an event handler to take action on particular app events.

The project we are working on uses Spring Boot as its foundation in Spring Core. Spring Boot will do us a lot of automatic configuration.

We will remove Spring Boot from the project in the final module of this course. This will allow us to manually configure all Spring Boot's objects and information sources. Students can gain insight into all of Spring Boot's functionality and how to handle a more complex Spring Setup.

**[9. Microservices with Spring Cloud](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Fh5UMknfYAU&mid=39197&u1=quickcode&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmicroservices-with-spring-cloud%2F)**

Deploy Applications for Spring Boot to the AWS Cloud.

Large scale businesses are very common with the Spring Framework. Nonetheless, the most popular Java framework is Spring.

In at least 3 different environments, a typical company will deploy its Spring Framework application. It is common to have an environment for development, testing, and production.

The challenge faced by developers for each environment is different.

* Different server names.
* Different databases.
* Different user accounts.
* Different passwords.

In this course, you will learn how to deploy your application in many different environments using Spring's IoC container. Your Spring application can wire itself to the needs of each environment through Inversion of Control.

Begin the Spring Framework course discovering advanced configuration choices.

Next, the route takes a stance to DevOps. You will see how to operate applications from the Spring Framework in various environments.

Using a H2 in-memory database is common in development. This database, of course, is only short lived. Not something you would like to use for the deployment of your production.

Would you like to see how to use MySQL to flip a switch? Turn another switch and use an Amazon-managed RDS database for your application. You can do this without modifying the script.

Also, the course looks like the best practices used in the development of enterprise applications. It is a best practice to use a continuous integration server. Jenkins is the database with the most common server CI. You'll learn how to install Jenkins on a server running Linux. A database which you built in the cloud of the AWS. Once you've got Jenkins working on your AWS server, setting up Jenkins on a convenient URL is the best practice. Jenkins runs as port 8080 Java application. To enter Jenkins, you wouldn't want to type some IP colon 8080 into your browser.

Docker is a technology that is exciting for you'll see how Docker can be used to host your own repository of Artifactory Maven. Artifactory will be used to handle the building of artifacts created by Jenkins.

We're also going to use Docker to set up a MySQL database server for fun. We're going to do this by supplying AWS with a Linux server running Docker on it, and then deploying MySQL in a Docker container.

It will also supply our Spring Boot application with an app server that we can use. Right from Artifactory, you'll pull the Spring Boot jar and tell it to link to a database server.

MySQL databases have also been managed by Amazon AWS. This is their support to the RDS. You'll see how to make your own RDS database available. In order to connect to the RDS server, we must reconfigure our Spring Boot application

There is a lot of fun and challenging content in this course. You will learn:

* How to handle the properties of Spring.
* Why you want sensitive properties like passwords to be encrypted.
* How to use Spring Profiles.
* To set up Spring using YAML.
* To provide Amazon AWS servers.
* Logging through SSH to your servers.
* How to install software on Linux using the yum task manager.
* How to customize your own service for Linux.
* How DNS functions and how to set up your own hostnames using Route 53.
* How to use GitHub webhooks to immediately trigger your builds.
* Why you don't want your application to use root accounts.
* Set up Jenkins to implement a Maven build.
* Using Jenkins to use Artifactory to build artifacts

This is a very realistic test. You will need an account on AWS to get the most out of this program. To complete the course assignments, you should be able to use the AWS free tier.

You'll need a domain name to get the most out of this course. You're going to need domain control Without all this, subdomains can't be configured in Route 53.

The course takes advantage of AWS for its cloud services. On the AWS platform the expertise you gain will be applied to most corporate environments. To imitate the typical company, AWS is used.

**[11. Learn Spring Boot — Rapid Spring Application Development](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Fh5UMknfYAU&mid=39197&u1=quickcode&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-boot-intro%2F)**

Without any complexity, Spring Boot gives you all the power of the Spring Framework. So, start writing apps soon.

Spring Boot and the Spring Framework make it easy to build driven apps and services that operate on their own and can be maintained with minimal hassle. It also offers features that are ready for production such as metrics health checks and even externalized configuration. It is an application designed to run everywhere, which implies you can build executable JARs, which is one of such sort of program's most desirable aspects.

Though learning this type of application may seem like a challenging task, this course constructs learning from Spring Boot and Spring Framework in an easy way to understand. With topics such as an introduction to the Framework and step-by-step guidelines for developing your first application, this course is ideal for nearly any user.
