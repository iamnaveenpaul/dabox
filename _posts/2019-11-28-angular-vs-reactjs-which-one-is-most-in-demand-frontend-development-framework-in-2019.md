  in 2019?'

Javascript is among today's most common programming languages. There are a number of programmers, freshers and skilled ones who love to use Javascript to create their application or project but there is still uncertainty when they need to pick up the right framework or tools for their project.

Angular and ReactJs are their primary concern, but most of them are still unable to agree which one could be perfect for their project. Freshers are eager to know which one is simple and easy and which one has more profession-related market opportunity.

Let’s have a brief look into Angular and ReactJs.

AngularJS was developed and launched by Google in 2010. It was called as AngularJS until 2016. In 2016 Angular team released AngularJS 2 that was a recompilation of AngularJS but it was in fact an entirely new framework, so the angular team ended up dropping JS from the namesake and labeled this new framework Angular.

React is developed and maintained by Facebook and it was released in 2013.

We will bear in mind that ReactJS is a library for developing dynamic user interfaces, whereas Angular is a comprehensive framework. ReactJS has a higher priority than Angular according to StackOverflow survey. And Google Trends still claims that ReactJS is the most common library. Now we're going to compare them both depending on some criteria to determine which one would be best to choose between.


**Learning Curve:**

Angular is a full expanded framework so when someone wants to build an application or project on Angular they need to learn a lot of stuff like Typescript in detail, MVC still has so many other aspects to understand including directives modules, decorators, components services pipes and templates. In terms of planning, it requires learning the detection of change, zones, compilation of AOT(Ahead-of-Time), and Rx.js. Angular offers a lot of items "out of the bag." It has comprehensive coding that provides a clear structuring, but when someone chose to enter Angular, there are several things to learn.

And from the other end, ReactJs is just a library so in contrast to Angular, it has less structure to understand. React uses JSX (Javascript XML), a means for JavaScript to construct HTML. So we need to learn JSX syntax on how to write components, handle internal state, setup props, routing and using Redux to manage the system etc. React will not provide functions that are "out of the box." React offers mobility and allows programmers too many ways to do the same job differently. It's easy to learn quickly in comparison to Angular.

**Components and Size:** 

Angular works on Real DOM and MVC pattern follows. Angular often implements bidirectional data flow in size (92 KB approx, this may change) relative to React. On the other hand, React works on Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of a Real DOM, or we can say JS representing the actual DOM. React assumes unidirectional flow of data and React is smaller than Angular size (46 KBapprox, this may change).

**Migration and Community Support:**

Angular launches the latest version or upgrades every six months. Therefore, two major releases or updates are required in a year to make the necessary improvements. Since it was released, developers have experienced so many breaking changes. Large and active Google communities support Angular and its current version is 7.0. React is maintained by Facebook and its latest version is 16.0. Also for Facebook stability, updates in React are easier than Angular when it comes to releasing its new version because major companies such as Twitter and Airbnb are using React. It also has strong community support.

**Application:** 

Because of its full-blown architecture design, Angular is most commonly used for massive applications such as the video streaming software or music instrument app. ReactJS, on the other hand, is just a library so it's perfect for SPA (Single Page Application) or it doesn't need any formatting.

Angular is used by companies Google, Forbes, Youtube, Wix, telegram and React is used by companies Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Airbnb, Netflix, Paypal, Uber.

**Market Trend or Jobs:**

If we try to search for the jobs for Angular and React on StackOverflow and Upwork, we find that the developers of React are more available than Angular and their demand is high.

**Conclusion:**

We need to bear in mind that there is no perfect framework or library, if we want to rush to a conclusion. Choosing a framework or library depends entirely on the level, requirements and objectives of your project. Every framework or library has certain advantages and disadvantages, the same goes for React and Angular. From the factors above, if you are a newbie or have less coding exercise but also if you want solidity for your project, you could go with React since it's a fast learning curve and it's also higher than Angular role in the industry. If you choose Angular, it may be frustrating because you will experience major upgrades for Angular after every 6 months. Another aspect is if you want to build a large-scale project with a full blown system and then love to follow straight forward programming approach, you should go for Angular.
