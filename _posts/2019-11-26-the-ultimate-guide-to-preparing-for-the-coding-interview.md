**All you need to get set for technical interviews, behavioral questions and wage talks**

Every organization has a different way to question the employees, and you need to be prepared for all those situations.

The smaller the company, the less formal the layout of the interview. Smaller firms and companies are likely to do only 1-2 live programming interviews (interactive interviews with a platform such as Codepen or an actual IDE or whiteboard interviews) or they may send you a small project to complete on your own.

Big companies like Google or Facebook start with a recruiter's phone screen, then do 1-2 telephone technological interviews where you do the coding, and then go on to on-site interviews.

**Task #1:** Go ahead and read the Tech Interview Handbook [Interview Formats](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/non-technical/interview-formats.md) page produced by a Facebook worker, Yangshun Tay, to learn how different companies arrange their different interviews.

Regardless of the format and amount of meetings, the following types of questions need to be prepared: **Technical questions, Model questions and behavioral questions**.

Let's look at each of these types of questions and let's set some targets to be effective.

**Technical questions**

Specific inquiries can be about data structures and algorithms, languages, and frameworks that are used in the business you meet.

At this stage, to learn data structures and algorithms, you should have used tools like Hackerrank, Learneroo, and Leetcode. You will start the daily practice with Leetcode when applying for jobs.

Keep in mind that these types of questions can be asked using a real IDE or online tool that allows you to execute the software, or in a Google Doc or whiteboard where you need to be able to write code without much help. All these different scenarios should be learned.

You should have plenty of experience with a stack of your choice when it comes to specific technologies, languages and frameworks. We'll learn Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and React at [Microverse](http://microverse.org/), the school of mobile software developers that's free until you get a job, but it doesn't really matter what you choose so long as you stick to a stack and get really good at it.

I'm going to assume that you already know how to build things with your stack.

We will also continue to use the book "[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. I really recommend you buy it or try to find it in the local library if you don't have it.

**Task #2:** Read section VII of the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book review chapter: Technical questions.

**Task #3:** Perform only the first coding assignment in each chapter of [this](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/tree/master/algorithms) page (i.e. Array, dynamic programming, geometry, Graph, Hash, etc.) using your preferred language as a refresher of data structures and algorithms.

You're going to use a new platform called Leetcode. The Tech Interview Handbook section also includes a description of each software model or algorithm if you need a refresher. Read it before you try the coding challenge.

**Task #4:** Find resources to check yourself against the most frequently asked conceptual questions about the various technologies you learn. If you don't know the answer to a question, go ahead and learn about using Google before you attempt to see the solution.

Here are some "conceptual questions" explanations for the different languages we are teaching at Microverse. If you use the same stack, please use these links freely. Then, use it to grasp what you need to find resources on Google. Keep in mind that conceptual questions vary from programming concerns in a way that they are more abstract and you should not write code for answering them most of the times.

Set a limit of 45 minutes for each set of questions to render this job a little more endurable. Feel free to spend some time working together with a partner on these issues. You should take turns to respond and clarify each other's responses.

Mind that to do mock interviews for getting ready for the actual job interviews (more on this later) and even while applying to jobs to continue to practice these kinds of questions.

**System Design Questions**

Interviewers introduce a particular product (e.g. a social network, a search engine, a URL shortener) in these types of questions and you are expected to design the system and structure for that particular product.

You probably already know some of the elements in the project-DNS server, cache, load balancer, databases, etc. Often, though, still seasoned programmers struggle with these kinds of questions.

You are not intended for designing a system that is super robust and flawless. The interviewer assumes you're an entry-level designer who has actually never successfully developed a scalable device at the production level.

Such kinds of questions provide you with an opportunity to show that you tackle big issues. To test the conclusions about the project you are going to build, you can ask many questions, and with the aid of the interviewer, you will tackle the layout in a very iterative manner.

Here's a set of activities you can complete to get ready for queries regarding system design. Completing all of these things will take you a while, so chances are you won't even be asked these kinds of questions as you're going to apply for entry-level positions.

You'll learn a lot about the actual software development world here, however. Take your time and do it, just don't get into a hole in your rabbit. If required, feel free to skip through certain pages. Whenever you need it, you can go back to many of these principles.

**Task #5:** Read the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" section 9: System Design and Scalability.
Please read “Example Problem”, but don’t try for completing “Interview Questions” yet.

**Task #6:** Donne Martin, Facebook engineering manager, has developed another great open source tool to support interviews with people. Go ahead and read "[How to approach a system design interview question](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#how-to-approach-a-system-design-interview-question)."

You're supposed to come up with the elements you'd use to model the process in Step 3 and Step 4 from the previous link and then talk about how you'd scale things up. Let's study every device design's main components and processes for scalability.

**Task #7:** Read about the four ways a system can be scaled:

[Scalability for Dummies - Part 1: Clones](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
[Scalability for Dummies - Part 2: Database](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
[Scalability for Dummies - Part 3: Cache](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
[Scalability for Dummies - Part 4: Asynchronism](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

**Task #8:** Read about every software system’s different components (you don’t have to grasp everything in depth, but you should be aware of the different components and concepts):

[Domain Name System (DNS)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#domain-name-system)
[Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#content-delivery-network)
[Load Balancer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#load-balancer)
[Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server)
[Application layer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#application-layer)
[Database](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#database)
[Cache](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cache)
[Asynchronism](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#asynchronism)
[Communication](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#communication)

**Task #9:** Select 2-3 companies from [this](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#company-architectures) list that you like and learn about their design.

**Task #10:** Look at the responses to the two problems of design:

[URL Shortener](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2016/03/08/system-design-interview-question-create-tinyurl-system/)
[Collaborative Editor](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2016/03/22/system-design-interview-question-how-to-design-google-docs/)

These are high-level answers and are strong enough for a place at the entrance level. If you're curious about what more senior developers are planning, take a look at [this more detailed answer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) to the Shortener URL layout question.

**Task #11:** Ultimately, pick any 2 questions from [this](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/tree/master/design#specific-topics) list of development questions and try to answer them as if you were in a real interview using pen and paper, or any text editor. I propose that you ask a friend or colleague to do this so that you can support each other.

Note here that I continue to recommend that you try things with a friend or colleague as some of these moves can be difficult and frustrating, and studying alone can be difficult. We don't have live lessons or instructors. Alternatively, our students learn to code mobile pairs in tiny shared groups. As the proverb in Sweden says:

Shared joy is a joy double its original value; shared sorrow is sorrow half its original value.

**Behavioral Questions**

Organizations don't just want to hire people from a technical perspective who are really successful. They also want people with whom they will enjoy working and people who are a good cultural match for the market.

That's why the interviewer can pose certain personality questions at some stage in the interview process, such as: "Why do you want to work here?"Tell me about a campaign where you have encountered an obstacle with your team and have been able to successfully solve it."

Each segment in this is intended to help you get ready to answer any of these questions with ease.

**Task #12:** Read section V of the “Cracking the Coding Interview” book Introduction: Behavioral Questions.

**Task #13:** Achieve the "Interview Preparation Grid" described in the book using a file from Google Docs. If you can mostly use software projects, it is perfect, but if there is any interpersonal scenario (e.g. leadership) that you can't think of a software project, use a non-software project to fill in the matrix.

**Task #14:** Using the technique of the S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result) and the general guidelines from the book, write down and add the answers to questions from the book (i.e. "Weaknesses" and "Tell me about yourself") and each query from the previous assignment in the "General" chapter of [this](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/non-technical/behavioral.md) list to the Google Doc.

Using Google Docs "Share" button to encourage anyone with a connection to post and then connect the file with your advisor or any other colleague and seek input. It's always good to look at this with a second pair of eyes. Try to sound normal to your responses.

**Other questions**

Although the most important part of your interviews will be academic, development and cognitive issues, it is important to remember certain questions and advice that will be useful during the interview process.

**Questions to ask**

Asking good questions during the interview not only makes you look smart, but it's also something you should do before you consider any deal to get to know the company and the people there. The interview is a system in two-way direction. Don't forget about that!

**Task #15:** Look at [this](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/non-technical/questions-to-ask.md) list's issues and use them as a guide for your future interviews. They don't need to be memorized immediately.

**Psychological tricks**

[Here](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/non-technical/psychological-tricks.md) are some other mental tips to help you get in contact with your interviewer. Keep in mind these suggestions while interviewing.

**Negotiation tips**

When the long-awaited moment comes and you get a job offer, note to always compromise. However, negotiating well is an art.

**Task #16:** Read [this](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/non-technical/negotiation.md) list of 10 negotiating criteria and return to them whenever you need to negotiate an offer. To get a more detailed description of each of the laws, follow the two references at the top of that post.

**Mock interviews**

It's a great idea to do mock interviews before you venture into real ones. You will not only have the ability to be comfortable in addressing some of the most common questions in an atmosphere that looks like the real world, but you will also know how to control your emotions so that you can appear calmer and more relaxed during interviews.

Here's a quick table generator used to create Microverse [mock interviews](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_228bDllazltWrq7WrLaKCs3dHXlGHBybWz9nnRvSc/edit?usp=sharing):

The students use this table to quiz each other as they apply for jobs. Most of these queries are unique to the stack they teach, but you can find a friend or relative to try to generate a similar list of your friend's questions and encourage them to do the same for you.

While questioning your mate, you'll need to be the "expert" in the house, so spend a total of 2 hours training yourself the answers to those questions. Google can be used to find the optimal response/answer to each problem especially to coding questions so that you can lead your coding partner before he finally discovers the same solution.

Note: We also advise that you try to practice some of the answers before meeting with your partner, particularly the behavioral ones, in front of a mirror or with a [rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).

There are two websites I enjoy discovering people and making mock interviews that you may want to do. One of them is [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/), the other is [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/).

You should be able to prepare for any job interview you will ever face as a software developer with this comprehensive guide in hand. Implement all of these suggestions and when the time comes, and you'll feel confident.
