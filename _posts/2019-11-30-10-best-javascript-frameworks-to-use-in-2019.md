JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language which promotes types of programming that are event-driven, functional and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based). Originally, JavaScript was used only on the client side. These days, though, JavaScript is also being used as a programming language on the server side. To sum up, JavaScript is the language of the web in a simple phrase.

**What is the JavaScript framework, and why to use one?**

A software framework is an abstraction in which additional user-written code can be used to selectively change code that provides generic functionality. JavaScript platform is a JavaScript application framework where programmers may modify and use the features for their convenience.

Frameworks are more adaptable to web design and are therefore preferred by most web developers. JavaScript frameworks are a software type tool that makes it simpler and faster to operate in JavaScript. These frameworks also enable the programmer to code the application as responsive and sensible device. This sensitivity is yet another explanation why JavaScript frameworks are very common when it comes to using a high-level language of the system. Let's dig at 2019's strongest JS Frameworks.

Top 10 JavaScript frameworks

**1. [Angular](https://angular.io/)**

Angular is one of JavaScript's most effective, productive and open-source frameworks. This framework is run by Google and is used to create a [Single Page Application](https://hackr.io/blog/why-should-you-learn-angular-in-2019#Angular_supports_Single_Page_Applications) (SPA). This expands the HTML to the application and interprets the data binding attributes.

**2. [React](https://reactjs.org/)**

The React platform was developed by Facebook and gained popularity within a short period of time. It is used to build and run the high-incoming traffic dynamic web pages user interface. It makes use of a virtual DOM, and therefore it is easier to integrate the same with any application.

**3. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**

Although the Vue JavaScript platform was created in 2016, it has already entered the market and proven its value by providing various features. Its dual integration mode is one of the most attractive features for high-end SPA or single-page application creation. It's a very consistent platform for cross-platform development.

**4. [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/)**

Ember.js was introduced to the software market in 2015, and has become popular with its wide application area since then. Ember.js ' frameworks enable binding of two-way information and thus provide a stable framework to manage complex user interfaces. For their websites, popular websites such as LinkedIn, Netflix, Nordstrom, and many more use the Ember. JS platform.

**5. [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)**

Meteor (also Meteor.js or MeteorJS) domain field fits the brand itself as it encompasses virtually the substantial part of software development as it is distributed. Uses of this framework involve important areas such as back-end development, database management, business logic, and front-end rendering.

**6. [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)**

Mithril is a JavaScript platform on the client side that is mainly used to build single-page applications. Since there are no derived functions from a base class, it is easier to implement the framework. It is tiny (< 8 kb gzip) and fast, providing out of the box routing and XHR utilities. It has a few similar characteristics to React.

**7. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**

Node.js is a runtime environment on the server side of JavaScript that runs on all platforms and is open source. The framework with its event-driven architecture is capable of driving asynchronous I/O. It works in the JavaScript Runtime environment and thus shows similar JAVA properties such as threading, packaging, loop forming.

**8. [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)**

The polymer is an open-source, Google-developed JavaScript framework that can build website elements without moving into a complex level. It also allows data linking on both one-way and two-way, thereby providing a broader implementation field.

**9. [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/)**

Aurelia framework is JavaScript's latest version that can be used to implement any interface. It is the next generation platform for much more reliable websites to be created. Aurelia's code will expand the HTML to include data binding for different purposes. The modern architecture often means the toll is meant for client-side and server-side understanding at the same time.

**10. [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)**

Backbone Framework is one of JavaScript's most common frameworks where learning and understanding is simple. To create single-page applications, it can be used. Developing this framework involves the concept that all server-side functions need to flow through an API, where by having to write fewer code would help achieve complex functionalities.

These were the top 10 frameworks we like in JavaScript. Which of them is your favorite? Are there any special JS frameworks we managed to miss?
