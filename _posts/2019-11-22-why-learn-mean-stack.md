As JavaScript is popular and widely used. There’s no doubt that the online course platforms (like Khan Academy) and more and more coding bootcamps are switching to Javascript as their language of instruction.

But do you know the reason for any startup founder looking most often for a MEAN Stack developer? We thought about sharing this with you.

**The top reasons are:**

* People are increasingly going straight to Javascript (and Skipping Ruby, Python and PHP) because you can’t do much for the web development platform without it.
* JavaScript takes the pride for the most active developer community.
* Employers, broadly speaking, want engineers, and most specifically are on the Javascript   based technologies front. Also, those happen to be the ones that compose the MEAN STACK — MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js

As we can see in this chart, Node.js is the clear cut winner in terms of job growth by a large extent.

Some data driven points from [indeed.com](http://indeed.com/) on why MEAN STACK has become so popular?

* Node.js & Express.js are the basic essential elements of web development framework that powers the MEAN Stack. Node.js was released less than 8 years ago, but it’s already been adopted by Microsoft, Linkedin, Walmart, SAP and many others. 
* MongoDB , It’s the Database that the MEAN Stack uses. Mongo is also popular with the Rails apps, and is the default database for the Meteor.js project.

Note here that the demand for MongoDB employer is the fastest growing amongst the NoSQL databases.

**Some facts on MEAN STACK:**

* It’s been used by Uber, PayPal, Linkedin among many others.
* Angular.js , Google (and by extension YouTube) have invested a ton of expenses and engineering talent into the improvement of Angular.js in all possible aspects.
* Each one of the MEAN Stack’s individual tools are emerging as the winners in their respective category.

From the standpoint of these in Jobs, Learning MEAN stack as a whole provides you with a lot of benefits, one of them is in ‘switching’ to its corresponding equivalent tool, say if an employer demands a project to be done in Backbone.js instead of Angular.js for whatever reasons, you would have been already familiar with one and can easily learn the other without much consumption of time and resources as all these have JavaScript as a language in common.
