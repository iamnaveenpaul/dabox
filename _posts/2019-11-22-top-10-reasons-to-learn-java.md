**What is Java?**

Java is an object-oriented, general-purpose programming language developed at Sun Microsystems by James Gosling in 1991. The Java software compilation results in the bytecode that can be run using the [Java Virtual Machine](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/) on any computer. For this reason, Java is also known as a language of WORA (write once, run anywhere).

The first thing that comes to mind when you see the word ‘software engineer’ is the Java language, you might have heard the language more than anything else. Java as advertised is found in almost everywhere, be it your car or blu ray disc players, or mobile phones and tablets, toys or any computing machine. The aim of Java was to make the programming safe, strong, compatible, robust and able to have an interpreter written for it, supports parallelism and dynamic typing. There are no references to data for its objects external to themselves, because it’ 99% object oriented and unlike C++, it uses automatic memory allocation and garbage collection.

A programming language by Sun Microsystems for more than 20 years. It’s powerful, easy to learn, object-oriented, independent of the hardware architecture and platform and you can compile and code into any machine language with JVM (Java Virtual Machine), where you can write the code once, and be able to run it anywhere. The JVM is Platform dependent that compiles the code into the low level machine code, so has a good cross platform capability.

With such business industry at an immense interest for java applications that around 3 billion devices were already running on Java across all cross platforms 5 years ago, you can take the word that this language is all time favourite for beginners.

Java is one of the most common programming languages in modern times because it can be used to develop customized applications that are light and simple, serving a variety of purposes. Java is the number one programming language, according to the [TIOBE Report](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) for April 2019.

Moving ahead, let’s organize our top 10 reasons on why to learn Java:

**1. Java’s Popularity and High Salary:**

A Java Developer's average salary ranges from $47,169 to $106,610 a year. It is one of the world's most widely used languages and according to Oracle reports, it is used by some 9 million developers and runs on about 7 billion computers worldwide. It’s developers are also very sought after because of the high demand in the industry, and they hold the highest paid jobs.

**2. Java is Easy to Learn:**

Java is easy to learn and can be grasped as easy as English as it has a syntax similar to English but needs some time to get used to and time for logical and analytical skills depend a lot on how fast you can learn. You can also learn Java [tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-tutorials/) from GeeksforGeeks, a good source that will instruct you on how to get started with Java and learn how to do it.

**3. Java has a Large Community:**

A large online community of Java users ranging from novice to intermediate to expert levels, which are especially helpful in case any support is needed. Some of the educational online communities are [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java), [Java Forums](https://www.java-forums.org/forum.php), etc, where a great deal of language is learned and shared. There are also a lot of other resources available on the internet about Java like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/) so as to mention one.

**4. Java has an abundant API:**

Java mainly has three API (Application Programming Interface) forms, i.e. Registered Java core API's, Java API's optional registered and also Unofficial API's. Generally, these APIs are used for virtually everything including networking, I/O, servers, news, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.

Java has an extensive API that includes many Java classes, modules, interfaces, etc. This is useful to build applications without necessarily knowing their implementations within them.

**5. Java has multiple Open Source Libraries:**

In Java, there are multiple open source libraries including JHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons, etc in Java which can be used to make its development simpler, cheaper, reliable and faster. Open source libraries provide tools for copying, reading, modifying, sharing, etc.

**6. Java has Powerful Development Tools:**

Java has developed an Android operating system base and has selected about [90 percent fortune 500 companies](https://www.zipcodewilmington.com/blog/why-java-skills-matter-now-and-in-the-future) to develop most back-end applications. It also plays a major role in data processing for Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.

In Java, there are many Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that provide programmers with different facilities for software development. Powerful Java IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, and so on, play a major role in Java's growth.

This IDE's provide many features such as debugging, highlighting syntax, code completion, language support, automatic refactoring, etc. that make programming easier and faster in Java.

**7. Java is Free of Cost:**

Java is very popular among individual programmers because it is available free under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL). This means that Java is free to develop and test environments, but a small fee is required for commercial purposes.

**8. Java is Platform Independent:**

Most Java applications are developed in Windows while running on a UNIX platform due to Java's platform-independent nature.

Java is separate from the platform as the Java source code is translated by the compiler to byte code that can then be implemented using the Java Virtual Machine on any platform. Java is also regarded as a WORA language because it is independent of the system.

**9. Java has great Documentation Support:**

When programming in Java, Javadoc provides a great guide to make understanding the code very easy. One of the main reasons is that the Java's support for documentation is excellent with Javadoc (documentation generator). The API documentation is created in HTML format using Java’s source code.

**10. Java is Versatile:**

Java has many features that make it quite flexible such as dynamic coding, platform-independent features, multiple security features, network-centered architecture etc. So, is very versatile because it uses different platforms to program applications on the internet, smartphones, desktop, etc.
